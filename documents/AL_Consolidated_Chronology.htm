      <span class='change'>The United States created Alabama Territory
      from the eastern half of Mississippi Territory. Boundaries were:
      on the east, Georgia; on the north, Tennessee; on the west, a
      line up the Tennessee River to Bear Creek, thence a straight line
       to the northwest corner of WASHINGTON, and thence due south to
      the Gulf of Mexico; and on the south, the Gulf, the Perdido
      River, and thence along the parallel of 31 degrees north latitude
       to Georgia. BALDWIN, CLARKE, MADISON, MOBILE, MONROE,
      MONTGOMERY, and WASHINGTON became Alabama counties. Non-County
      Area 1 became part of Alabama Territory. GREENE (Miss.), JACKSON
      (Miss.), and WAYNE (Miss.) were eliminated from Alabama, but
      their eastern ends, which fell east of the new
      Alabama-Mississippi boundary, became Non-County Areas 2, 3, and 4
       in Alabama Territory.</span>
