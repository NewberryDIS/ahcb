      granted to John Mason the territory to be called New Hampshire,
      lying between the Merrimack and the Piscataqua Rivers and
      extending up to 60 miles inland from the coast. The remainder of

      <span class='change'>The Council for New England, faced with
      competition from Massachusetts and less success than expected in
      managing its own colonies, tried to protect the interests of its
      principal members, including Ferdinando Gorges (for Maine) and
      John Mason (for New Hampshire), by first distributing all its
      land among them and then, on this date, surrendering its charter
      to the crown. Members hoped the king would a) confirm the land
      grants they had made to themselves, b) abrogate the Massachusetts
       charter, and c) create a new royal colony for all of New England
       with Gorges as its governor. Technically, this threw all of New
      England, outside of Massachusetts, under the direct jurisdiction
      of the crown, but some earlier grants remained effective.</span>

      August 1652) was the parallel of 43 degrees, 40 minutes, 12
      seconds north latitude. Massachusetts used this interpretation to

      occasionally broke out later, this line became the boundary
      between New Hampshire and Vermont and has not changed to the
      present. When New York refused to recognize land titles through
      the New Hampshire Grants (towns in present Vermont created
