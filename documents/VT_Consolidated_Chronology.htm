      <span class='change'>Massachusetts declared an interpretation of
      its 1628/1629 charter that would make its northern boundary an
      east-west line through a point three miles north of the most
      northerly part of the Merrimack River, which it decided later (1
      August 1652) was the parallel of 43 degrees, 43 minutes, 12
      seconds of north latitude. Massachusetts used this interpretation
       to claim part of Maine and, until 1740, to create a few towns in
       present southern Vermont and southwestern New Hampshire.</span>
