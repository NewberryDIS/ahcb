<span class='change'>The United States purchased Louisiana from France, taking
formal possession on 20 December 1803; boundaries were not clearly defined, but
included the western half of the Mississippi drainage basin (from Mississippi
River to the Rocky Mountains). Though the area west of the Rocky Mountains
(present Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and parts of Montana and Wyoming) was
claimed by Great Britain, the Lewis and Clark expedition helped establish the
basis for the future United States claim to region.</span>

Canada lying west of the Continental Divide. Great Britain, Spain and Russia

United States established the parallel of 49 degrees north latitude as the
northern boundary of the United States and the southern boundary of the British

Mountains” should be jointly occupied by the United States and Great Britain
for a term of ten years. The area covered in this joint occupancy included all
of present Oregon, Washington and Idaho, parts of Montana and Wyoming, and the
portion of present Canada lying west of the Rocky Mountains (Continental
Divide). No northern limit was defined.</span>

<span class='change'>The Oregon Boundary Treaty between the United States and
Great Britain ended joint occupancy of the Oregon Country when it set the
international boundary "along the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude
to the middle of the channel which separates the continent from Vancouver's
Island; and thence southerly through the middle of said channel, and of Fuca's
Straits, to the Pacific Ocean." The treaty also created a disputed area by
failing to specify which of the multiple passages through the San Juan Islands
was meant by "the middle of said channel." Great Britain claimed a line
through Rosario Strait, the eastern most passage, while the United States
claimed a line through the Strait of Haro, the western most passage. The
dispute over this water boundary was finally settled on 21 October 1872. Oregon
considered the disputed San Juan Islands to be part of LEWIS. British North
America gained all the parts of CLACKAMAS (Ore.), LEWIS, and VANCOUVER (now
CLARK) which lay north of 49 degrees north latitude.</span>
