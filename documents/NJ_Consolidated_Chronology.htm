<span class='change'>King James I chartered two Virginia Companies, headquartered
in different English cities, to establish colonies along the coast of North
America, including islands within 100 miles and, by implication, extending
inland 100 miles. Both charters covered New Jersey. The Virginia Company of
London was assigned the coast between 34 degrees and 41 degrees north latitude,
and the Virginia Company of Plymouth was assigned the coast between 38 degrees
and 45 degrees north latitude. The colonies of the two companies were to be at
least 100 miles apart, even where the grants overlapped.</span>

<span class='change'>New Jersey was created when the Duke of York sold the area
(not yet occupied by the English) to John Berkeley and George Carteret for a
proprietary colony. The area was defined as all land between the Delaware and
Hudson rivers and south of a straight line from the intersection of the
Delaware River and the parallel of 41 degrees north latitude to the place where
the parallel of 40 degrees north latitude crossed the Hudson River. Actual
transfer was August 1665. The straight line between the rivers ran through an
area unsettled by colonists and was not demarcated.</span>

the Dutch, captured New Amsterdam (29 August 1664), took control of New Jersey,
and renamed the province New York. The Treaty of Breda (1667) confirmed this
conquest. The governor of New York administered New Jersey.</span>

<p class='event'>
<span class='change'>George Carteret and the other New Jersey proprietors
executed the Quintipartite Deed to divide New Jersey into two distinct
colonies, East New Jersey and West New Jersey. Both colonies were unorganized
and technically were non-county area, and here they are known, respectively, as
Non-County Area (West) and Non-County Area (East). A version of the dividing
line that was different from the original specifications was accepted and
demarcated in part in 1687 (Keith Line), the remainder was redefined in detail
in 1688; segments of this line have been used to compose many county
boundaries. Parts of the 1688 line must be estimated, and this compilation uses
the versions chosen by John P. Snyder for his book on New Jersey's internal
boundaries. Another survey of the dividing line, more accurately reflecting the
original deed, was performed in 1743 (Lawrence's Line); it affected land
ownership but not the county lines.</span>

</p>

<p class='eventdate'>1681</p>

<p class='event'>
<span class='change'>West New Jersey created from the Non-County Area (West) the
county-like courts of Burlington and Salem but did not provide definite limits
for them [not mapped]. Together, the unbounded courts covered the southern half
of the colony, which area is mapped here as a single polygon under the name
Indefinite Counties Area. The northern portion of the colony remained
completely unorganized. The boundary between Non-County Area (West) and the
Indefinite Counties Area is estimated to run along Assunpink Creek, where the
line between Burlington and the non-county area would be formalized in 1694.</span>

<p class='eventdate'>8 January 1686/1687</p>

<p class='event'>
<span class='change'>Commissioners from East and West New Jersey settled details
of the boundary to separate their colonies. Their version of the boundary lay
to the west of the line described in the Quintipartite Deed of 1676. In April
and May of 1687, George Keith surveyed the new line from Little Egg Harbor to
the South Branch of the Raritan River where he was stopped. Segments of that
boundary, known as the Keith Line, have been the basis for many county
boundaries.</span>
<span class='citation'>(Another survey of the dividing line, more accurately reflecting
the original deed of 1676, was performed in 1743. That became known as
Lawrence's Line, and it affected land ownership but not county lines.) As a
result of that change, ESSEX gained from Non-County Area (West), MIDDLESEX
gained from Non-County Area (West) and from Burlington Court in Indefinite
Counties Area, and MONMOUTH gained from Burlington Court in Indefinite Counties
Area [Burlington not mapped].</span>

<span class='change'>The Non-County Area of West New Jersey gained from ESSEX and
SOMERSET in East New Jersey when the absentee governors of East and West New
Jersey agreed on a compromise boundary between the two colonies from the north
end of the Keith Line (1687) eastward to New York. This line was the boundary
between the colonies until 1702 when they were unified, after which it
continued as a boundary between counties. Two segments of the boundary between
ESSEX and Non-County Area (West) must be estimated, and this compilation has
adopted the versions chosen by John P. Snyder for his book on New Jersey’s
internal boundaries. The southern limit at Assunpink Creek is estimated, based
on long use.</span>

King James II by King William III and Queen Mary II) in England, Bostonians
imprisoned the royal governor and other officials, thereby ending the Dominion
of New England. Over the next months the Jerseys and the other colonies that
had been united to form the Dominion had to resume self-government. Local
officials in East and West New Jersey continued to perform their duties on
their own authority until proprietary government was re-established in 1692.</span>
