    <span class='change'>King Charles II granted Connecticut a charter
      as a self-governing corporate colony, with an eastern boundary
      at Narragansett Bay, overlapping part of the Rhode Island
      patent.  Rhode Island did not concede its claim to territory
      between the Pawcatuck River and Narragansett Bay (the
      Narragansett Country), but Connecticut quickly took control of
      the area.</span>

      dispute over the Narragansett County by dismissing
      Massachusetts's claim and placing the area under royal
      jurisdiction. The area was named King's Province, and Rhode
      Island was given temporary administrative authority over it,
      pending a conclusive royal decision. Connecticut's claim to the
      area slipped into abeyance but was not abandoned until the
      boundary settlement of 12 May 1703.</span>
