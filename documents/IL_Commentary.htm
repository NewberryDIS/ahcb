      <p>Illinois land was once part of the
      national public domain and, as such, was divided for sale
      according to the federal rectangular survey system. Although the
      earliest county creations and boundary changes in present
      Illinois were based principally on river systems and extended
      arbitrary lines, lawmakers quickly recognized the utility of
      basing boundaries on the survey system. Thus the Illinois
      territorial legislature began incorporating range, township, and
      section lines into county boundary descriptions early in its
      tenure, and the state legislature continued the practice. The
      lines laid down by those early land surveyors are still in use
      and remain a prominent and important feature of the modern maps
      used to make this atlas. Given the persistence of the survey
      lines and their appearance on modern federal maps, plotting
      county lines based on the land survey is easier and more precise
      than working with metes and bounds descriptions that depend on
      ridge lines, river systems, and local landmarks.</p>

      <p>A few boundary lines cannot be precisely
      drawn. Some involve natural features or local landmarks
      difficult to locate, while a few reflect the vagueness and
      imprecision of the laws on which they are based. These uncertain
      boundaries are identified by "estimated line" and "indefinite limit,"
      respectively. Occasionally a boundary line cannot be drawn as
      described, due to some oversight or error in the legislation or
      typographical error in the printed statute. The legislature's
      intent is usually apparent, however, in other provisions of the
      law in question or in later boundary changes, and in these cases
      the intent-rather than a rigid interpretation-of the law has
      been followed.</p>

      <p>For example, when Fayette County was
      created on 14 February 1821, it was to include all territory
      north of its prescribed southern boundary. It is clear, however,
      that the legislature intended Fayette to extend north only to
      the Illinois River, not to the state boundary with Wisconsin,
      since Pike County (created on 31 January 1821) covered all of
      Illinois north of the Illinois River. A literal interpretation
      of the statute creating Fayette, then, would split Pike in
      two-an interpretation clearly at odds with future boundary
      changes. Also, a provision of the statute creating Cook County
      in 1831 cannot be mapped. The law directs that all territory
      north of Cook's northern boundary (defined as the state line
      with Wisconsin), to the Rock River, be attached to Cook
      County. In 1831 there was no territory in Illinois north of Cook
      County (the Illinois-Wisconsin boundary was established in
      1818), and thus the legislature's intent is unclear.</p>

      <p>The General Assembly's first restriction
      on creation of new counties was enacted in 1827, when it
      directed that existing counties could be divided only on
      petition of a majority of the county's qualified voters. In 1845
      the legislature further required that all new counties contain
      at least 400 square miles, that existing counties not be reduced
      below 400 square miles by boundary changes, and that altered
      boundary lines must be at least 10 miles from the county seats
      of existing counties.</p>

      <p>The state constitution of 1848
      incorporated the provisions of the 1827 and 1845 laws, and also
      required that all boundary changes be approved by a majority of
      the voters of the affected areas. Beginning in 1837, the
      legislature had submitted many boundary changes to the voters
      for approval, so the constitutional requirement made mandatory
      what had up to that time been common practice. This democratic
      approach to creating counties is reflected in the fact that
      twenty-six proposed creations were submitted to the voters for
      approval between 1837 and 1867. The voters approved thirteen
      (Bureau, Cass, DeKalb, Douglas [on second attempt], Ford,
      Hardin, Jersey, Kankakee [on second attempt], Pulaski, Richland,
      Saline [twice], and Williamson), and rejected thirteen (Allen,
      Audubon, Benton, Coffee, Douglas [on first attempt], Harrison,
      Holmes, Kankakee [on first attempt], Lincoln, Michigan, Milton,
      Okaw, and Oregon). Voters also rejected fifteen proposed
      boundary changes between existing counties. The constitution of
      1870 continued the provisions of the 1848 constitution, while
      the 1970 state constitution simply states that all county
      boundary changes must be approved by the voters of the affected
      counties.</p>

      <p>A prolonged controversy over the creation
      of Saline County was eventually settled by the state supreme
      court. Saline was created from Gallatin County, by referendum,
      in August 1847. However, a bitter legal contest over the
      location of Gallatin's county seat finally induced the
      legislature, in 1851, to abolish both Gallatin and Saline
      counties and to combine the territory of the two counties into a
      "new" county named Gallatin. The state supreme court declared
      the creation of the "new" county unconstitutional on the grounds
      that the voters of Gallatin and Saline had not approved the
      change, as required by the state constitution. The legislature
      responded by providing for a referendum on the creation of the
      "new" Gallatin County in August 1852. The voters rejected the
      proposal, and Saline County was thereby resurrected.</p>

      <p>In 1873 the General Assembly essentially
      made county boundary changes a local matter. It required that
      all changes involving more that one-half township (i.e., 18
      sq. mi.) could only be initiated on petition by a majority of
      the legal voters in the area to be transferred, to the county
      officials of the two affected counties. County officials were
      then required to hold an election within three months, and if
      the voters in each affected county approved the boundary change,
      the election result was to be reported to the secretary of state
      and the change took effect on 1 March following the
      election. When the area petitioned to be transferred was less
      than one-half township, the county officials could-at their
      discretion-either reject the petition or hold the required
      election. All of these basic provisions were included in the
      Revised Statutes of the State of Illinois, 1885.</p>

      <p>Many counties were created in Illinois
      before there was adequate population to support them. The
      legislature therefore devised a system of attachments, whereby
      newly created counties were attached to existing counties for
      varying terms and purposes. The process by which unorganized
      territory was attached to existing counties changed over time
      and contained many ambiguities. Furthermore, the precise nature
      of the attachment is not always clear: in some laws the
      unorganized area was simply "attached" to an existing county,
      but in other cases the attachments were "for county purposes,"
      "for all judicial and other purposes," or "for all judicial and
      other county purposes." </p>

      <p>The earliest attachments, 1818-1823, were
      the least complicated. The legislature simply directed that the
      attached area (generally non-county or unorganized territory)
      was to remain attached to the host county until formed into a
      separate county or "otherwise disposed of" by the General
      Assembly. However, beginning with the creation of Hancock,
      Mercer, and Warren counties in 1825, the legislature frequently
      required that new counties have at least 350 inhabitants before
      a circuit court judge could authorize elections for the first
      county officers. In 1836, when Kane, McHenry, Ogle, Winnebago,
      and Whiteside were created, the law required that the counties
      prove-by petition to a circuit court judge-that they contained
      at least 350 "white inhabitants" before elections could be
      held. This population requirement superseded any dates for
      organizing counties included in the text of the laws.</p>

      <p>The statutes creating Boone (1837),
      DeKalb (1837), DeWitt (1839), Kane (1836), Livingston (1837),
      Ogle (1836), Stephenson (1837), and Winnebago (1836) "attached"
      them to existing counties, but it is clear from other provisions
      of the statutes that the period of attachment was merely the
      time required to set the new counties in motion. In each case,
      the statute creating the county also set the date for the
      election of the first county officers-usually several months
      after formal creation. In this volume, these counties are not
      defined as being attached.</p>

      <p>Of the ten Illinois counties attached to
      existing counties at creation, seven were later detached (i.e.,
      "organized") by separate statutes: Effingham, Jasper, McHenry,
      Mercer, Rock Island, Warren, and Whiteside. For the others
      (Iroquois, McDonough, and Hancock), the statute creating them
      authorized a circuit court judge to order elections for the
      first county officers when each had at least 350 inhabitants. In
      these cases, in the absence of a specific statute of
      organization, the compilers have used the date of the elections
      for the first county officers as the date each was detached
      (i.e., "organized"). Henry and Knox counties, although not
      attached to existing counties at their creation, were also
      required to have a population of 350 and thus had their
      organization dates as functioning counties delayed
      considerably.</p>
