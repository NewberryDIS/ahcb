      Companies, headquartered in different English cities, to
      establish colonies along the coast of North America, including
      islands within 100 miles and, by implication, extending inland
      100 miles. The Virginia Company of London was assigned coast

      Virginia Company of Plymouth was assigned coast between 38
      degrees and 45 degrees north latitude, both including present
      Pennsylvania. Colonies of the two companies were to be at least
      100 miles apart, even in area of overlapping grants.</span>

      Easterne Bounds," to extend northward to "the beginning of the 3
