<span class='change'>SUSSEX lost to ORANGE (N.Y.) and ULSTER
(N.Y.) when King George III approved the boundary between New Jersey and New
York, as determined by a commission appointed in 1769 at the joint request of
the two colonies after decades of dispute. Line defined as running from the
junction of the Delaware and Neversink rivers, a spot several miles south of
the terminus selected in 1719, to the Hudson River at the parallel of 40
degrees north latitude. The boundary was demarcated in 1774 and, despite small
adjustments later during resurveying and a New Jersey claim to Staten Island,
it has remained unchanged to the present.</span>
