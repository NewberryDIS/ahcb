      companies, headquartered in different English cities, to
      establish colonies along the coast of North America, including
      islands within 100 miles and, by implication, extending inland
      100 miles: the Virginia Company of London, assigned coast between
       34 degrees and 41 degrees north latitude; and the Virginia
      Company of Plymouth, assigned coast between 38 degrees and 45
      degrees north latitude. Colonies of the two companies were to be
      at least 100 miles apart, even in areas (including present
      Maryland) of overlapping grants.</span>

      south bank of the Potomac River, a line from the river's mouth

       the Potomac. Lord Baltimore claimed that this grant extended
