      <p>The first constitutional limits on the creation of new
counties in South Carolina were contained in the state constitution of 1868,
which required that the legislature ensure that new counties contain at least
625 square miles and that no existing county be reduced in area below 625
miles. These requirements were altered in the current constitution (adopted in
1895), which stipulates that new counties can be created when one-third of the
qualified voters in the area of the proposed new county petition the governor
for a new county, and two-thirds of the qualified voter in the same area
approve the creation in a subsequent election. If the voter reject the
creation, another election to create the same county cannot be held for four
years.</p>

      <p>The constitution further requires that the legislature, in
enabling legislation following approval by the voters, must ensure that new
counties contain at least 400 square miles, $1,500,000 of assessed taxable
property, and 1/124th of the state’s total inhabitants. Furthermore,
in the process of creating new counties, no existing county can be reduce to
less than 500 square miles in area, $2,000,000 of assessed taxable property, or
15, 000 inhabitants, and its boundaries must be at least eight miles distant
from its courthouse. The legislature also has the authority to alter the
boundaries of existing counties, provided the above four requirements for
existing counties are met and the voters in the affected areas approve by a
two-thirds majority.</p>

      <p>Several disputes involving these constitutional
requirements have been decided by the state supreme court. In 1899 the court
voided the initial creation of Lee County because two-thirds of the qualified
voters had not approved in that part of Darlington County to be included in the
new county. In 1902 Lee was created again, with slightly different boundaries.
The court upheld the creation of McCormick County in 1916, even though
Greenwood County (one of the counties from which McCormick was created) thereby
fell below the 500 square miles required by the constitution for existing
counties. The court ruled that Greenwood (created in 1897) was not covered by
the constitutional requirements for "old" counties, since it was
created after the 1895 constitution was adopted. The court also ruled that a
December 1914 Greenwood election, voided because many eligible voters were
denied the vote, did not count toward the four-year waiting period required by
the constitution; a valid election was held in December 1915.</p>

      <p>In another case involving the requirement that existing
counties contain at least 500 square miles, the court in 1951 upheld the
transfer of part of Beaufort County to Jasper County, rejecting the argument by
Beaufort officials that the transfer thereby reduced Beaufort below 500 square
miles of non-marsh or "high land." The court ruled that the word
"area" in the state constitution did not distinguish as to the
quality of such territory, that marshlands were included in the constitutional
definition of "area," and that the requirement that a county have at
least $2,000,000 of assessed taxable property after a reduction in size
answered the question of land quality. At the same time, the court declined to
uphold a referee's opinion that "area" also included inland waters,
since the constitutional requirement as to Beaufort's area was satisfied
without considering inland waters.</p>

      <p>In another case, the state supreme court ruled in 1921
that the legislature, in altering existing county boundaries, must enact any
boundary change exactly as approved by two-thirds of the qualified voters in
the affected area. The case involved a transfer of territory from Clarendon
County to Sumter County, in which more that one-third of the qualified
Clarendon voters in the affected area had petitioned for the transfer, and
two-thirds of them had approved in a subsequent election. However, before the
legislature approved enabling legislation, some Clarendon residents opposed to
the transfer produced their own survey of a revised boundary line and asked the
legislature to draw the new boundary according to their survey. The legislature
referred the matter to the supreme court, which declared that the legislature
had no authority under the constitution to alter the boundary line approved by
the voters.</p>

      <p>Counties, judicial districts, and parishes have served as
the basic units of local government at various times and places during South
Carolina's history. The historical boundaries of these units are mapped in this
atlas as they are recorded in the records of the Carolina Proprietors and
session laws of the legislature, without reference to the governmental role
each played at different times and places. However, it has been necessary in
some cases to supplement the maps with interpretative text to explain the
transition from one unit of government to another. For example, the boundaries
of the initial counties created in the late seventeenth century are mapped as
they appear in the official record. But they failed to develop as effective
units of government and were eventually supplanted by parishes and judicial
districts--although never officially abolished. To reflect this ambiguity in
status, the four counties are considered as "effectively eliminated"
when the colony was divided into seven judicial districts in 1769.</p>

      <p>A similar ambiguity accompanies the status of many of the
thirty-four counties created within the seven judicial districts in 1785. They
also failed to develop as functioning counties, and by 1791 the fourteen counties
created in the low country districts of Beaufort, Charleston, and Georgetown
had largely been abandoned. In that same year county government was suspended
in the four counties of Orangeburg District (Lewisburgh, Lexington, Orange, and
Winton), and those counties became, for all intents and purposes, defunct. In
this atlas, these eighteen counties are considered as being "effectively
eliminated" in 1791, even though their names survived in official records
for years thereafter.</p>

      <p>The remaining counties were absorbed into the judicial
district system in 1800, when twenty new judicial districts were created (and
five eliminated). From 1800 to 1868, then, the judicial districts were the
principal subdivisions of the state, with county and parish names surviving
mostly as geographical reference points. Finally, in 1868, a new state
constitution declared that the judicial districts were thereafter to be
"designated as counties" (Art. II, sec. 3), and they have remained
so.</p>

      <p>The ephemeral nature of many of South Carolina's counties
and judicial districts is reflected in the fact that eighteen counties and
districts have become extinct. In addition, two early incarnations of Berkeley
County, two early versions of Colleton County, two versions of Granville
County, and the original Marion County have also disappeared. Kingston and
Liberty counties were functioning counties for only a few years before they
became Horry and Marion districts, respectively.</p>

      <p>Parishes existed side-by-side with counties and judicial
districts from the early days of the colony to the Civil War, and even as their
functions dwindled parish names survived as geographical reference points. The
first parishes were created in the South Carolina low country in 1706 as
territorial units of the Church of England. But they gradually assumed many of
the functions of local government during the remainder of the eighteenth
century, and they continued to function as such well into the nineteenth
century. In some coastal areas, the parishes survived as election districts
until the Civil War. The judicial districts replaced all but two parishes (the
“late” parishes of St. Philip and St. Michael) as election districts in the
1865 state constitution, thus signaling the demise of the parishes as
functioning governmental units. (In this atlas the parishes are considered to
have been “effectively eliminated” on 27 September 1865, the date of completion
of the 1865 constitution). The 1868 state constitution completed the
transformation of local government when it stipulated that the judicial
districts were henceforth to be “designated as counties.”</p>

      <p>Some anomalies result from the ambiguities in the status
of governmental units outlined above. For example, in 1791 the legislature
essentially eliminated the four counties of Orangeburg District (Lewisburgh,
Lexington, Orange, and Winton) as operational units, yet in delineating the
boundaries of the area’s counties, election districts, and parishes in 1803 and
1805, the legislature continued to refer to the boundaries of the four
counties. However, it appears from the context of the two laws that the
reference to county lines was made primarily for the purpose of locating the
boundaries of election districts and parishes, not for altering the county
boundaries. The eclipse of the four counties is reflected in the fact that when
Barnwell District was created from Orangeburg District in 1800, the boundaries
of Orange and Winton counties were never altered to coincide with the new
district boundaries. Of the four original counties of Orangeburg District, only
Lexington survived to become a judicial district (in 1804), and it joined
Barnwell and Orangeburg districts in superseding the four counties. </p>

      <p>Similarly, two extinct counties, Claremont and Salem, pose
special interpretative problems. Salem was created from Claremont and Clarendon
counties in 1792, and those three counties made up Sumter District when Sumter
was created from Camden District in 1800. However, when Clarendon County was
established as a judicial district in 1857, the district boundaries were those
of the original Clarendon County of 1785--ignoring the creation of Salem County
in 1792. Although the law creating Clarendon District notes that Sumter District
was thereafter confined to Claremont County only, in this atlas Claremont and
Salem counties are considered as being "effectively eliminated" as
units of local government in 1800--when both counties became part of Sumter
District and failed to become districts in their own right.</p>

      <p>Another anomaly involves the boundaries of St. Bartholomew
Parish and the original Colleton County. When St. Bartholomew was created in
Colleton County in 1706, Colleton’s inland boundary had not yet been defined
(it is notated as an “estimated line” in this atlas), and thus St. Bartholomew
also had an undefined inland boundary. With the demise of the original Colleton
County in 1769 and the creation of a new Colleton County (in a different
location) in Charleston District in 1785, St. Bartholomew Parish was left with
an indefinite inland boundary. However, when Bartholomew County was created in
Charleston District in 1785, it had the same boundaries that St. Bartholomew
Parish would have had if its inland boundaries had been extended to the
Charleston / Organgeburg district line. In this
atlas, then, those parish boundaries are "implicitly extended" to
that district line in 1778, when the boundaries of three neighboring
low-country parishes (St. George–Dorchester, St. James–Goose Creek, and St.
John–Berkeley) were also extended to the district line by statute. (Bartholomew
County became extinct in 1791, while St. Bartholomew Parish continued as an
election district until 1865).</p>

      <p>Some imprecision in drawing the boundary lines of the
counties, judicial districts, and parishes is unavoidable, given the vagueness
and imprecision of many boundary descriptions, e.g., the "head" of a
creek or swamp or a line between river systems. Also, boundaries often involve
landmarks that cannot be identified today, e.g., the property of named
individuals, roads, marked trees, ferries, mills, and river landings. Finally,
some boundaries were ephemeral, disappearing completely in later boundary
changes and sometimes in existence for only a brief time. It is also apparent
that some county boundaries were not surveyed or clearly marked. In 1797, for
example, the legislature responded to a petition from some Fairfield and
Richland County residents, who asserted that the boundary separating the two counties
(both created in 1785) had never been run. Instead, another line--run
"some years ago"--was accepted by the residents as the boundary line,
and they asked the legislature to establish and run that "old" line
as the official boundary. The boundary established by the legislature in 1797
is significantly different from the line prescribed in 1785; in this atlas, the
1785 boundary is drawn according to the law creating the two counties, and the
boundary enacted by the legislature in 1797 is mapped as a change from that
1785 line.</p>

      <p>For many of the reasons mentioned above, some historical
county boundaries are conjectural; in this atlas they are notated as
"estimated lines" During the early years of county and parish
formation in South Carolina, some northern and western limits were left
undefined or extended to the limits of settlement; these are notated as an
"indefinite limit."</p>

      <p><b>Dates</b></p>

      <p>Every effort has been made to give the day, month, and
year (e.g., 25 February 1785) for all county creations, boundary changes, and
other events in this atlas. Occasionally it is impossible to date an event so
precisely, but a reasonable estimate is possible. When the precise date is not
known or an approximate date is more appropriate, the date is generalized to
the month and year (e.g., February 1785) or to the year alone. A lack of
evidence may make it impossible to give any date at all for a county's
creation, and its occurrence can only be confirmed by the record of a later,
related happening, such as the appointment of a sheriff. In such a situation,
the date of the later event is used with the simple addition of "by"
(e.g., by 25 February 1785) to indicate that the county creation or other event
occurred no later than that date and probably earlier. </p>

      <p>Several dates may be associated with the creation of a
county, judicial district, or parish or a change in boundaries. To many
individuals the date that makes the most sense is the one when people began to
observe the change, but in most cases that date is impossible to ascertain. An
alternative is the date on which the law effecting the change passed the
legislature or was approved by the governor. The date of passage is an
important reference because it helps identify the law; now, as in the past,
references to a law often include the date of passage. Most other compilations
of county changes have adopted the date of passage as their standard for the
date of change, but it is not always the best indicator of when change
occurred.</p>

      <p>The dating standard in this atlas is the legally effective
date of change, whether it be for the creation of a new unit of government or
for the alteration of lines between existing units. Through the colonial period
and into the nineteenth century, the date a law passed was generally the date
it went into effect. As the nineteenth century progressed, legislators
recognized the importance of preparing for the establishment of a new
governmental organization or for the shift in jurisdiction that accompanies
boundary changes. Some laws, therefore, began to carry two dates: one marking
the passage of the law and the other specifying when the boundary change would
go into effect. If the date of passage and effective date are different, the
law gives both. </p>

      <p>Using effective dates means that many of the dates in this
atlas may disagree with dates in other references. Dating events before 1752 is
a problem because the calendar then in use is very different from the one in
use today. Whereas by 1600 most of Europe had adopted the Gregorian calendar,
as the modern system of reckoning the days is called, England observed the
Julian calendar until 2 September 1752. For the purposes of this atlas, the
chief differences between the two systems are, first, numbering the days and,
second, designating the change from one year to the next. There has been no
attempt to convert the dates of one system to those of the other. Differences
in numbering days, therefore, are effectively ignored; whatever day and month
are given in a source are the day and month used here, regardless of whether
the document was written in England or some other country, before or after
1752. Under the old, Julian calendar the last day of the year was 24 March and
the first day was 25 March, which means that in England and its colonies the
day after 24 March 1750 was 25 March 1751. This atlas follows the convention of
showing both years for dates that fall within the period from 1 January through
24 March when the different calendars call for different years. Thus,
successive dates before England's adoption of the Gregorian calendar would
occur as follows: the day after 24 March 1688/1689 would be 25 March 1689; the
day after 31 December 1689 would be 1 January 1689/1690. About three months
later would come 24 March 1689/1690, and the next day after that would be 25
March 1690.</p>
