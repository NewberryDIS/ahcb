      <span class='change'>King Charles II created Carolina from Virginia colony
      territory and granted it as a proprietary colony to eight of his
      suporters (the Lords Proprietors). Limits were: on the north, the
      north end of Lucke Island and the parallel of 36 degrees north
      latitude; on the west, the Pacific Ocean; and on the south, the
      St. Marys River and, from that river westward, the parallel of
      31 degrees north latitude. Included all of present Georgia, North
      Carolina, and South Carolina, and Alabama and Mississippi north of
      31 degrees north latitude.</span>

      Albemarle (in the Albemarle Sound region), Clarendon (for the
      Cape Fear area), and Craven (for the area south of Cape Romain,
      in present South Carolina). The boundaries of Clarendon and
      Craven were not defined, and they never functioned effectively as
       counties; Albemarle, with broadly defined boundaries, operated
      only briefly as a county, in present North Carolina.</span>

      <span class='change'>King Charles II granted a new charter to the
       Carolina Lords Proprietors, expanding their jurisdiction north
      and south. New boundaries were: on the north, a line from the
      north end of the Currituck River westward to "Wyonoak" Creek and
      thence due west along the parallel of 36 degrees, 30 minutes
      north latitude; on the west, the Pacific Ocean; and on the south,
       the parallel of 29 degrees north latitude. New southern line
      would have taken in Spanish settlements in Florida south of St.
      Marys River The new northern line implicitly redefined the
      southern limit of Virginia as the parallel of 36 degrees, 30
      minutes north latitude; although this definition has not changed,
       attempts at demarcation have produced an unusually irregular
      boundary. Included all of present Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi,
      North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.</span>
