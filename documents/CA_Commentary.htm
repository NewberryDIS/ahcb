      <p><b>Early History</b></p>

<p>County development did not begin in California until after the area came under the
control of the United States. Beginning in the mid 1700s, California was
explored and colonized by Spain, but Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821
resulted in California falling under the authority of Mexico. Settlement was
primarily limited to a narrow area along the Pacific coast, while knowledge of
the interior remained sketchy. During the years of Mexican rule, from 1822 to
1848, Mexico created ranchos, missions, ayuntamientos, and districts, often
with overlapping jurisdictions, to extend civil and religious authority over
the settled parts of California. However, unlike Texas, where the early Mexican
municipalities became the first counties, there is no direct linkage between
the Mexican civil jurisdictions and the original California counties.</p>

<p>One feature of the Mexican period did have an important influence on the development of
county lines—the Mexican land grants, or ranchos. Eight hundred thirteen land
grants were made under Mexican rule, and many of them figure in county boundary
descriptions from the earliest days to the present. While the use of land grant
boundaries suggests a precision in the delineating of county lines, the reality
was often quite different. Rancho boundaries were often vaguely defined, and
most land grants were not actually surveyed until long after their
incorporation in county boundary descriptions. For this project, the surveyed lines
of land grants are used in mapping boundaries, unless other evidence
demonstrates that another line was in actual use.</p>

<p><b>California Statehood</b></p>

<p>Unlike almost all other western states, California never achieved territorial status.
From 1846, when United States troops first landed in California during the
Mexican War, until September 1849 when delegates met to draft a new state
constitution, authority was fragmented among remnants of Mexican civil
bureaucracy, U.S. military rule, and various extralegal endeavors such as the
Bear Flag Revolt. The constitutional convention met in September 1849 in
Monterey, decided to skip the territorial phase, and proceeded directly to
craft a state constitution. Matters then moved quickly, and the state
government went into operation on 20 December 1849 when Peter Burnett was
inaugurated first governor of California. The state legislature also began
meeting in December, although the United States Congress did not officially
admit California to the Union until 9 September 1850.</p>

<p>County creation was one of the most important issues facing the new legislature, and
in February 1850 it passed an act creating twenty-seven counties that covered
all of the state's territory. Thus, except for Mare Island, California had no
&quot;non-county&quot; areas that existed outside the bounds of a county, a
phenomenon that was common to many other states. However, this desire to
establish at least some semblance of government oversight in every corner of
the state did not translate into neat, clear, unambiguous county boundary
lines. Early legislators recognized their lack of geographical knowledge of the
interior, and many of these early interior boundaries were defined in the most
general terms. For example, the northern boundary of Calaveras County was first
described in 1850 as &quot;following the summit of the dividing ridge between
Moquelumne and Cosumne rivers; thence due east to the State boundary line&quot;
(California Laws 1849, 1st sess., ch. 15, sec. 25/p. 63). There was
also a question of whether mining districts should be incorporated into
counties, given their transitory populations. Despite some opposition in the
legislature, the districts were included in the final county creation bill that
was passed on 18 February 1850.</p>

<p>In 1852 California became involved in the first of two county disputes with Nevada.
California proposed Pautah County to be located entirely in present Nevada
(then Utah Territory), contingent upon the United States transferring a large
portion of Utah Territory, including Pautah, to California. That never
occurred, and in 1859 California abandoned efforts to organize Pautah County.</p>

<p>The second dispute was less calculated and due more to lack of information. The boundary
between California and Nevada began to be surveyed in the 1860s, although the
official surveys were not completed until 1873. In 1861, Mono County was
created along the eastern border of California. No one actually knew precisely
where the state line was, and Aurora became the county seat of Mono County.
About the same time Nevada territorial officials made Aurora the county seat of
Esmeralda County, Nevada Territory. Thus Aurora had the distinction of
simultaneously serving as the county seat of two counties located in different
states. In the fall of 1863, the boundary commission reached Aurora and
determined that it lay about three and one-half miles inside Nevada, thus
ending its tenure as county seat of Mono County, California.</p>

<p>The creation of California counties proceeded rapidly, from the twenty-seven
original counties created in 1850 to the creation of California's fifty-eighth
county, Imperial, in 1907. Since that time, no major changes have taken place
in county boundaries, although numerous smaller adjustments have occurred. As
the federal land survey proceeded through California, many of the boundary
changes shifted county lines from less precise features, such as ridge lines or
lines run due east or west from a certain point, to boundaries running on the
federal land survey lines. Most California counties became fully organized
immediately after their creation. This is in contrast to other states where
counties often remained unorganized for years, or even decades. Only four of
the original California counties were unorganized and attached to fully
organized counties: Colusa, Marin, and Trinity for periods of fifteen months or
less; Mendocino for nine years.</p>

<p><b>Twentieth Century Changes in County Boundaries</b></p>

<p>In 1941, the state legislature passed an act that permitted the changing of county
boundaries without going through the legislative process (California Laws 1941,
54th sess., ch. 493/pp. 1801–1805). The boards of supervisors of the
affected counties were allowed to make changes, following strict requirements
set forth in the law. For example, counties were not permitted to move a line
more than five miles, or reduce the size of any county by more than five
percent. Counties were required to file such changes with the Secretary of
State and the State Board of Equalization. The original act of 1941 has been
amended several times and is still in force. The State Board of Equalization
provided a list of some two-dozen boundary changes filed since 1944. Individual
counties were contacted to obtain copies of the relevant ordinances and
resolutions; wherever possible, the changes have been mapped. In a few cases,
detailed information could not be obtained. At the same time laws regarding
county boundaries continued to be passed by the legislature. In some cases,
these simply codified a change already decided between two counties; in other
cases, the legislation appears to be unrelated to local decisions. </p>

<p><b>Small Changes and Proposed Counties</b></p>

<p>Very small changes (indicated by “_pt.shp”) are not mapped on the <i>California
Interactive Map of Historical Counties.</i> However, information on these
changes is provided in the chronologies, which include the date of change,
counties involved, and the source of the information. The locations of most
small changes in California are available as part of the California Tiny
Changes shapefile. (For information about the GIS files see the Atlas of
Historical County Boundaries homepage).</p>

<p>Counties
whose creations were authorized by the legislature, but never took effect, are
known as “proposed” counties. Information on proposed counties is provided in
the chronologies. Proposed counties can be viewed on the interactive map by
activating the “Unsuccessful Proposals” Layer. Proposed changes between
existing counties are not available on the interactive map, but they can be
found in the California Historical Counties shapefile (see the homepage for
more information).</p>

<p><b>Sources</b></p>

<p>California is one of a handful of states for which a well-done county boundary compilation
exists. Owen C. Coy's, <i>California County Boundaries</i> (1923, reprinted
1973), was very useful for this project. This carefully researched work
provides a lot of background information on the "Why" of county
formation and includes information on discussions that took place in
legislative committees, much of which did not result in actual boundary
legislation. The Mexican Land Grant maps in Warren A. Beck and Ynez D. Haase's,
<i>Historical Atlas of California</i> (1974) were helpful for correctly
locating ranchos mentioned in boundary legislation. </p>

<p>Historical maps do not frequently play a large role in these compilations and are treated
as secondary, rather than primary sources. Still, historical maps occasionally
are indispensable for identifying lost landmarks and names of individual
landowners. Important historical maps for California included the forty-two
county landownership maps from the Library of Congress reproduced on
microfiche. Also useful were <i>Topographical Railroad and County Map of the
States of California and Nevada,</i> A. C. Frey and Co. (1868); William M.
Eddy's 1854 <i>Official Map of the State of California</i>; and <i>Britton and
Rey's Map of the State of California,</i> compiled by George H. Goddard (1857)<i>.</i>

<p><b>Acknowledgements</b></p>

<p>Special thanks are due David J. Martin of the California State Board of Equalization
for researching and supplying a list of boundary changes reported to that
office since 1944. Queries to several dozen counties were met with generous
responses. County board members, county administrators, LAFCO officials, and
clerks of the boards of supervisors took time to track down county ordinances
and minutes of board meetings. This work would not be as comprehensive without
their assistance.</p>
