         <span class='change'>Acadia County created by Orleans Territory to "comprehend the Parishes of
      St. James and the Ascension, commonly called the First and Second Acadian Coasts. The parish or
      parishes referred to in this Act of 10 April 1805 were existing ecclesiastical jurisdictions
      (established under previous Spanish rule) rather than precisely defined civil divisions. The
      ecclesiastical districts had never been precisely bounded, nor did such parishes exist throughout
      the new territory. As a result, county boundary lines can only be estimated. After creation of civil
       parish system in 1907, the early county divisions were generally used for certain electoral and
      taxation purposes. In 1843 the county was abolished as an electoral unit, and when the state
      constitution was rewritten in 1845 all remainders of the county system were eliminated.</span>

         <span class='change'>CONCORDIA Parish created within Concordia County. The nineteen parishes
      created on 14 April 1807 were civil divisions which reused the earlier ecclesiastical boundaries and
       names. The division into civil parishes did not abolish the twelve counties established on 10 April
       1805. This and subsequent laws set up a dual system in which the counties existed "for the purpose
      of making the election of the representatives of the territory, and levying the territorial taxes",
      while the parishes took over jurisdiction of all civil, criminal, probate and other judicial
      matters. The dual county / parish system remained in effect until the state constitution of 1845.
      Though there was no legislative act formally abolishing the old counties, the 1845 constitution
      dropped all reference to the county as a civil or legislative division and redefined the limits of
      parish autonomy and authority. [Creation of original 19 parishes approved 31 Mar 1807, became
      effective 14 Apr 1807]</span>

      matters. The dual county / parish system remained in effect until the state constitution of 1845.
      Though there was no legislative act formally abolishing the old counties, the 1845 constitution
      dropped all reference to the county as a civil or legislative division and redefined the limits of
      parish autonomy and authority. [Creation of original 19 parishes approved 31 Mar 1807, became

      boundaries and names. The division into civil parishes did not abolish the twelve counties
      established on 10 April 1805. This and subsequent laws set up a dual system in which the counties
      existed "for the purpose of making the election of the representatives of the territory, and levying
       the territorial taxes", while the parishes took over jurisdiction of all civil, criminal, probate
      and other judicial matters. The dual county / parish system remained in effect until the state
      constitution of 1845. Though there was no legislative act formally abolishing the old counties, the
      1845 constitution dropped all reference to the county as a civil or legislative division and
      redefined the limits of parish autonomy and authority. [Creation of original 19 parishes approved 31

      series of disputes over the boundaries between Orleans Territory and Spanish possessions to the east
       (Florida) and to the west (Texas). On 5 November 1806 American and Spanish military commanders
      reached an agreement concerning the western boundary by declaring the disputed territory Neutral
      Ground. The boundaries of the Neutral Ground were only loosely defined as an area between the Sabine
       River on the west, the Arroyo Hondo on the east, the Gulf of Mexico on the south and the
      thirty-second parallel of latitude on the north. Though the agreement stipulated that no settlements
       would be established within the Neutral Ground settlers from both the United States and Spain
      continued to move into the Neutral Ground. The counties of Natchitoches, Opelousas and Rapides,
      created by Orleans Territory on 10 April 1805, and the Parishes of NATCHITOCHES, RAPIDES and ST.
      LANDRY created 14 April 1807, included land within the disputed territory. Ownership of the Neutral
      Ground was not officially settled until the Adams-Onis Treaty in 1821 [not mapped].</span>

       to in this Act of 10 April 1805 were existing ecclesiastical jurisdictions (established under
      previous Spanish rule) rather than precisely defined civil divisions. The ecclesiastical districts
      had never been precisely bounded, nor did such parishes exist throughout the new territory. In cases
       where no ecclesiastical parish existed (like Ouachita) the general limits were defined by
      established areas of settlements. As a result, county boundary lines can only be estimated. After
      creation of civil parish system in 1907, the early county divisions were generally used for certain
      electoral and taxation purposes. In 1843 the county was abolished as an electoral unit, and when the
       state constitution was rewritten in 1845 all remainders of the county system were
      eliminated.</span>

      of Saint Francis." The parish or parishes referred to in this Act of 10 April 1805 were existing
      ecclesiastical jurisdictions (established under previous Spanish rule) rather than precisely defined
       civil divisions. The ecclesiastical districts had never been precisely bounded, nor did such
      parishes exist throughout the new territory. As a result, county boundary lines can only be
      estimated. After creation of civil parish system in 1907, the early county divisions were generally
      used for certain electoral and taxation purposes. In 1843 the county was abolished as an electoral
      unit, and when the state constitution was rewritten in 1845 all remainders of the county system were
       eliminated.</span>

      old counties, the 1845 constitution dropped all reference to the county as a civil or legislative
