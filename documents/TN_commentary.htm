      <p>Prior to the establishment of the state of Tennessee in
1796, the territory that presently makes up the state was claimed, and in some
cases actually controlled, by several different entities: the Virginia Company
of London, the Lords Proprietors of Carolina, both the colony and later the
state of North Carolina, Spain, the state of Franklin, and the Territory of the
United States South of the River Ohio (Southwest Territory). Only North
Carolina and the Southwest Territory created operational counties within the
bounds of present Tennessee before statehood, all but one of which still exist
today. See below for an explanation of the counties authorized by the state of
Franklin.</p>

      <p>A number of factors make Tennessee one of the most
challenging and complicated states produced by the Atlas of Historical County
Boundaries Project. The first challenge is the large number of county boundary
changes. Most states recorded between 150 and 300 boundary changes and
creations throughout their histories. There are over 1,100 individual laws
creating or changing county boundaries in Tennessee. Putnam County alone
tallied over ninety different boundary changes. In the year 1889, the Tennessee
General Assembly passed fifty different laws concerning county boundaries; in
just one single day, 17 May 1915, the Assembly passed eighteen different county
boundary laws, possibly a national record.</p>

      <p>The second challenge relates to the type of boundary changes
set forth in the laws. About 900 of the 1,100 laws relate to “liners,” that is,
individual landowners who lived on or near the county boundary line and who
wished to have all their property consolidated in one county. Most states have
permitted little or no county boundary legislation that was explicitly designed
for the convenience of a single individual. In states where it has been allowed
to a limited extent, such as Kentucky or Alabama, the compilers of this series
have been able to locate most of these landowners and to mark the spot along a
boundary. That was impossible to do in Tennessee because most “liners” were
identified by name only, with no clue as to their location. Many of these
changes are so small that they would be visible only on a very large-scale map.
A typical example is found in the following 1905 law which detached one-eighth
of an acre from Benton County and attached it to Carroll County: 
<i>“Beginning  on a large cedar tree on the
county line runs [sic] east 48 feet to a plum tree; thence north 72 feet to a
plum tree; thence west 48 feet to the county line; thence with said county line
south 72 feet to the beginning, containing about one-eighth of an acre, so as
to detach from Benton County and attach to Carroll County the land upon which
is situated the residence and outbuildings of S.C. Walker”</i> (Tenn. Acts
1905, 54th assy., ch. 20/p. 53). In another instance, a line was run
25 feet down the center of the Porterfield Schoolroom, detaching half the
school from Rutherford County, and attaching it to Cannon County (Tenn. Acts
1891, 47<sup>th</sup> assy., ch. 254/p. 489).</p>

      <p>Legislators recognized the problems that such personalized
legislation presented and several attempts were made to limit or control such
changes, but they were unsuccessful and “liner” laws continued unabated. An
1895 law was designed to <i>“remedy this evil”</i> of transferring lands <i>“without
any diagram, plat, survey or measurement, [which] leads to much uncertainty and
difficulty in ascertaining where county lines really are,”</i> but little
seemed to change (Tenn. Acts 1895, 49th assy., ch. 105/p. 171).
Another result of this practice is the large number of legislative repeals in
which a county line is moved around the farm of a citizen one year and moved
back at some future date, often the very next session of the legislature. Liner
laws are still being passed at the end of the twentieth century. </p>

      <p>Changes made to accommodate local landowners, combined with
frequent decisions to run boundaries along mountain ridges, resulted in many
Tennessee counties having highly irregular boundaries. It has proved
practically impossible to tie each jog and turn in the modern line to a
specific piece of boundary legislation. However, every boundary law is listed,
both in the consolidated chronology and in the individual county chronologies,
regardless of whether it can be mapped or not. This atlas has mapped “liners”
and other small changes (if the location can be determined) as a small point or
dot along the boundary line. This file of small changes is not available on the
Tennessee interactive website maps. These changes are in a separate shapefile
that is part of the downloadable version of Tennessee, designed for use with
Geographic Information Systems (GIS).</p>

      <p>Because of the large number of unmappable changes in
Tennessee, it has several times been necessary to map aggregate changes in one
map that shows cumulative change over a period of time. For example, the modern
boundary between Wilson and Smith Counties was generally established in 1801,
but it experienced numerous small changes between 1860 and 1939. During those
seventy-nine years, there were eleven boundary changes in this line, but the
location of only three of the changes is known. Smith County, version 18 (dated
6 March 1939), depicts the net sum of changes in its boundary with Wilson
County from the first unmappable change in 1860 to 1939, when the last change
in the boundary occurred. Lacking an authoritative map or other source for the
shape of that line at intermediate dates, the depiction of cumulative change is
the approach least likely to present an error or to mislead users.</p>

      <p>The three Tennessee State Constitutions, 1796, 1835, and
1870, all set standards for the creation of new counties, such as minimum size,
minimum population, and proximity to adjacent county seats. Under the 1835
constitution, a new county was not allowed closer than twelve miles to an
existing county seat; this changed to eleven miles under the 1870 constitution.
Between 1835 and 1877, state legislators unsuccessfully tried to create
fourteen new counties in Tennessee. Some failed because voters in the affected
area voted against the new county, but in other cases legislators were unable
to carve a county out of an area while maintaining the required minimum size
and distance from nearby county seats. All proposed counties are mapped, with
the exception of Hatchee County, for which no boundary description was given in
the enabling law. Some of the proposed counties took on rather bizarre
proportions as legislators tried to work around the constitutional requirements
(see especially the long, thin Bell County, and the hourglass-shaped Etheridge
County). Two of today’s counties were created in almost the same places as two
of the unsuccessful proposals: Cheatham where original Cumberland would have
been located, and Chester where Wisdom County was proposed. Maps of the
proposed counties can be found on the interactive website maps in the layer
marked “Unsuccessful Proposals;” they are also available as part of the
downloadable shapefiles for Tennessee.</p>

      <p>Counties created in Tennessee by the state of Franklin in
the 1780s are particularly problematic. Delegates from the eastern Tennessee
country met in Jonesborough in 1784 to establish a new state that was not under
the jurisdiction of North Carolina, with the intention of petitioning the
United States Congress for admission to the Union. The General Assembly of
Franklin recognized the existing eastern Tennessee (then North Carolina)
counties of Greene, Sullivan, and Washington, and in 1784 and 1785 the state of
Franklin authorized the creation of five more counties. The acts have not
survived, and the precise boundary descriptions are unknown. North Carolina,
which then had jurisdiction over the Tennessee country, never recognized the
legitimacy of the state of Franklin and sought to regain control of the area.
The Franklin counties are included in the consolidated chronology, but no attempt
has been made to depict the counties or include them separately in the
individual county chronologies due to this lack of mappable boundary
descriptions. Rene Jordan, a local Tennessee scholar, has taken an alternative
approach in an attempt to reconstruct these counties in his articles on Hawkins
and Sumner Counties in <i>Tennessee Ancestors</i> (see Bibliography for 
complete citations).</p>

      <p>Tennessee legislators recognized the limits of their
geographical knowledge and therefore permitted surveyors quite a bit of freedom
in demarcating county boundaries. County creation laws often explicitly
authorized surveyors to alter lines if necessary as they prepared the original
plats, few of which appear to have survived. The law that created Cheatham
County in 1856, for example, specified taking territory from Dickson County,
but that did not happen because the surveyor determined that including part of
Dickson would reduce Dickson below its constitutional minimum size. He
explained: <i >“I would respectfully remark
that from the want of time I was unable to survey Dixon [sic] County before the
5th of Sept., the day appointed by law to ascertain the will of the
people in regard to the county of Cheatham, supposing that Dixon had at least
considerably over her constitutional complement of square miles, but, after
surveying Dixon I find her short 46.21 sqr. miles; consequently I have left out
the small fraction previously taken from her”</i> (Binkley, 31). Unfortunately,
this type of explicit evidence is rare, and most modifications by surveyors,
while recognizable, are not well documented.</p>

      <p>A look at the counties in Middle Tennessee in the early
1800s reveals a number of county lines that appear as though they should run
due north-south but actually tilt somewhat east of due north. The county
creation laws indeed specified “due north” or “due south” lines, but the
surveyors who marked those boundaries in the early nineteenth century did not
make enough allowance for the variation of magnetic north (indicated by the
compass needle) from true north, thus the eastward slant. This slant can still
be seen today in the eastern and western boundaries of Hickman County and the
eastern boundary of Dickson County.</p>

      <p>A predictable result of all the uncertainty surrounding
county lines was that many disputes arose and ended up in court. One can only
guess at the number of cases settled at the local court level, some of which,
no doubt, resulted in small shifts in the county lines that remain
undiscovered, despite the efforts of local historians and this research
project. However, a significant number of county boundary disputes progressed
all the way to the Tennessee State Supreme Court. Rulings of the State Supreme
Court have played an important role in the establishment of several county
lines and are cited in the chronologies.</p>

      <p>In 1972 the Tennessee General Assembly gave the State Board
of Equalization full authority to determine the location of county lines,
regardless of the reasons for a dispute. Boundaries can still be changed by
special legislation, or a landowner can have a change accepted by the assessors
of both counties. Changes made by the local assessors’ offices could not be
documented and included in this atlas. The State Board of Equalization records
changes and incorporates them on its current maps. The Board of Equalization
does not maintain a historical record of county boundary changes, and without a
centralized archive it is nearly impossible to find all locally generated
changes. In Tennessee, many county lines remain uncertain and the task of
reconciling boundaries between counties is likely to extend well into the
future.</p>

      <p>Research on early Tennessee laws was facilitated by <i>Laws 
of the State of Tennessee, Including
Those of North Carolina Now in Force in This State; From the Year 1715 to the
Year 1820, Inclusive,</i> compiled by Edward Scott and published in 1821. The
published series, <i >State Records of North
Carolina</i>, was also useful for identifying county creations and boundary
changes in Tennessee between 1777 and 1790, when the Tennessee country was
under the control of North Carolina. <i>Land Laws of Tennessee</i> (1891), 
compiled by Henry D. Whitney, has been considered
the authoritative guide to state laws on county creations and boundary changes.
However, a comparison against the state session laws revealed a number of
omissions in Whitney. While the volume is relatively complete up to the Civil
War, Whitney did not include some of the laws that changed county boundaries
for the convenience of “liners,” those people living on or near the county
line.</p>

      <p>The mapping of pre-1800 Tennessee county lines was made
easier due to the careful work done by Rene Jordan of the East Tennessee
Historical Society. His series of articles in <i >Tennessee Ancestors</i>, 
begun in 1994 (see Bibliography for a complete
listing), was invaluable, as was his willingness to share information and
ideas. While the renderings in this atlas do not agree in every instance or
detail with the sketches prepared by Jordan, there is broad general agreement
on the development of Tennessee counties before 1800.</p>

      <p>The number of large-scale or detailed nineteenth-century
maps of Tennessee is quite small, compared with other states, but one
historical map was critical for this project: Matthew Rhea’s 1832 “Map of the
State of Tennessee.” Based on Rhea’s own field surveys, it was the most
accurate map of Tennessee to that date. Although not officially sponsored or
sanctioned by the state, this map clearly took on quasi-official status. In
October 1832, the Tennessee General Assembly authorized funds to purchase
copies of Rhea’s map <i >“sufficient to
furnish one map to each of the colleges in East Tennessee, one to the Nashville
University, and one to each of the incorporated county academies of this State,
and one to each State of the United States”</i> (Tenn. Acts 1832, 19th assy., called 
sess., priv., ch. 93/p. 78). It appears that Rhea’s map was
consulted when new county boundaries were proposed. While his county lines
sometimes do not match the descriptions given in the state session laws, this
compiler has adopted his renderings, since they represent the accepted
boundaries of the time and because later changes were based on Rhea’s lines.</p>
