<p></p><b>Before Statehood</b></p>

<p></p>At various times throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries,
the area that became the state of Alabama fell under the jurisdiction of
France, Spain, and Great Britain and her colonies. Following the end of the
American Revolution, competing authorities laid claim to parts of Alabama,
although this often did not equate with actual control. Until 1802, Georgia
claimed all of present Alabama and Mississippi north of 31 degrees north
latitude based on its colonial charter. Great Britain had ceded East and West
Florida to Spain following the end of the American Revolution, and Spain
claimed most of the United States territory east of the Mississippi River and
south of the Tennessee and Hiwassee Rivers, an area that included present
Alabama and Mississippi. For the next thirty years, the United States, the
state of Georgia, and Spain sparred for control and each party took advantage
of ambiguous boundary descriptions and imprecise geographical knowledge to
further their claims. Spain actually controlled the area south of 31 degrees
north latitude as part of Spanish West Florida until April 1813 when the United
States captured the city of Mobile from Spain, effectively extending U.S.
control over the area.</p>

<p>Georgia took steps to secure its claim to that part of present Alabama
and Mississippi north of 31 degrees. In 1784 a group of land speculators from
Tennessee and North Carolina attempted to create a Georgia county along the
north side of the Tennessee River, near Muscle Shoals, in what later became
Alabama. They petitioned the Georgia legislature requesting the creation of
this county, which they proposed to call Houston (not to be confused with the
present Alabama and Georgia counties of the same name). The legislature did not
create the county as requested, but authorized the appointment of seven
commissioners to &quot;ascertain the Quantity, Quality and Circumstances of the
aforesaid lands,&quot; and to grant warrants of survey. The unauthorized county
of Houston sent a representative to the Georgia legislature in an attempt to
legitimize the county, but he was not seated, and in August 1786 a bill to
create Houston County was defeated by a vote of twenty-three to twenty-six.
However, in 1785 Georgia did create Bourbon County along the Mississippi River
in present Mississippi; Bourbon County lasted only three years.</p>

<p>On 7 April 1798 the United States created Mississippi Territory to cover
the area south of a line running from the mouth of the Yazoo River to the
Chattachoochee River, west of the Chattachoochee River, north of 31 degrees
north latitude, and east of the Mississippi River. On 24 April 1802 Georgia
ceded its claims to the territory south of Tennessee, and that area was added
to Mississippi Territory on 27 March 1804. From that date until 3 March 1817,
most of Alabama was part of Mississippi Territory; a number of early Alabama
counties were created by Mississippi Territory. To further complicate matters,
from 1804 to 1812 Orleans Territory, which became the state of Louisiana,
claimed part of Spanish West Florida and created its own counties in the
portions of present Alabama and Mississippi controlled by Spain.</p>

<p><b>Alabama’s County Boundaries</b></p>

<p>While many Alabama county lines run on Federal Land Survey lines and can
be drawn with great precision, surveying errors also played a part in
establishing county boundary lines. One example is a portion of the Cherokee-Calhoun
boundary that does not match the legal description. First described in 1832
when Benton County (now Calhoun) was created, the boundary was supposed to run
due east to the Georgia state line but the surveyor apparently ran it somewhat
south of east, and the line continues to follow that southeasterly course
today.</p>

<p>A number of Alabama county boundary changes could not be conclusively
documented. For example, when Crenshaw County was created in 1866, an entire
36-square-mile township of Montgomery County was assigned to Crenshaw, but all
evidence indicates that this provision of Crenshaw's creation was never
implemented and that the area actually remained a part of Montgomery County. A
similar case is found along the Pike-Bullock line where boundary descriptions
from various laws do not precisely describe the accepted present-day boundary.
One of the most puzzling situations involves a three-square-mile area of Walker
County along the Tuscaloosa line. This territory was a part of Tuscaloosa at its
creation in 1818, but through 1926 both counties assessed taxes there. Even
with the assistance of present county officials it was not possible to
establish precisely when and by what authority this area shifted to Walker,
although the change may date from a badly flawed 1850 law annexing three
one-square-mile sections located in the middle of Tuscaloosa County to Walker.</p>

<p>In a couple of instances it has been necessary to date a change based on
its appearance on a contemporary map. For instance, around the turn of the
century a small section of the Wilcox-Clarke line was changed from its previous
course along an old Indian boundary line to run on land survey lines. Maps of
the 1880s and 1890s show the boundary following the Indian line, and the annual
Rand McNally commercial atlases also show the Indian boundary until the 1902
edition, when the present line first appears. The change to the modern line is
thus dated 1901, although it has not been possible to document the exact time
and circumstances of the change.</p>

<p>Alabama boundary law has a special term, “liners,” for those people who
live on or near a county boundary line. Although people like liners are found
in the county boundary descriptions of many states, in Alabama they appear with
remarkable frequency; in 1895 the legislature formally defined them and spelled
out procedures for handling their requests for boundary changes (Ala. Acts
1894, bien. sess., no. 199/p. 346). Named liners first appear in legislation in
the 1840s. Legislation for liners generally took the form of local relief acts,
introduced on behalf of one or more named individuals who wished to establish
residence in a particular county. The reasons behind such requests can only be
surmised:some changes made it easier
for people to fulfill community obligations, such as militia duty or road work,
other changes may have saved people from having to cross a difficult river or
mountain range to reach the county seat, and in other cases the change may have
served the convenience of taxpayers and tax collectors alike by consolidating
property in a single county.</p>

<p>Legislation concerning liners varied. In some cases individuals were
made citizens of a particular county but the county line was not shifted; in
other cases individuals were made citizens of one county but paid taxes in the
adjoining county; and in still other cases the boundary line was actually
changed. Only those acts that actually altered the boundary line are included
in this work. In the few cases when liners' property or homes could not be
identified, the chronology indicates "location unknown."</p>

<p>Local histories sometimes were very useful for identifying places and
people in Alabama, including liners. Among the most helpful publications were
Marilyn Davis Barefield's compilations of Alabama federal land office records.
Alabama often used individual residences to delineate county boundary lines.
Locating the property of individuals who lived 100 or 150 years ago is
frequently unfeasible; Barefield's volumes made it possible to identify dozens
of past property owners and to draw historical boundary lines with a much
higher degree of accuracy than could otherwise have been achieved.</p>

<p>No doubt a certain amount of influence was required to persuade a
legislator to introduce such a piece of liner legislation, and it should be no
surprise that liners often were local officials, justices of the peace, and
major property owners. One interesting case involved H. J. Springfield, a
scalawag elected to the state legislature in 1868 from St. Clair County. After
the election, someone discovered that Springfield, who resided with his brother
Thomas M. Springfield, actually lived over the line in Etowah County. On 17
December 1868 the legislature passed an act &quot;that the boundary line
between the counties of Etowah and St. Clair, be changed, so as to include
Thomas M. Springfield as a citizen of St. Clair county.&quot; Rather than deny
H. J. Springfield his seat, the legislature simply shifted the county boundary
line, effectively moving him into the correct legislative district.</p>

<p>The disruption and disarray that characterized post–Civil War politics
in Alabama, as various factions vied for control of the state government,
affected the state's county boundaries. The 1866–1867 legislature created
Baine, Colbert, and Jones Counties, but in November 1867 the constitutional
convention abolished all three. Political fortunes soon shifted, and each
county was revived in identical or similar form. In 1868 Sanford was created
with the same territory as Jones, while Etowah was created in the same general
area as Baine. Colbert, named for two Chickasaw Indian brothers, was re-created
in 1870.</p>

<p>Alabama also provides the unique instance of a murder case nullifying a
county boundary line change. In 1903 Calhoun County gained a little territory
from Cleburne County; legislators voting for the change were unaware that this
reduced Cleburne County to less than five hundred square miles, required by the
state constitution as the minimum area for a county. In December 1905 William
Kline was arrested for murdering John Phillips in the area that had recently
been added to Calhoun County, a crime for which he was subsequently found
guilty and sentenced to twenty-five years in prison. Kline appealed the case to
the Alabama Supreme Court on the grounds that he was tried in the wrong court
since the boundary change was illegal. The Supreme Court agreed (Kline v. The
State, <i>Ala. Reports,</i> 146:1), and declared the boundary change
unconstitutional and void and remanded the case to the Circuit Court of Calhoun
County. Records indicate that the Calhoun County Sheriff was sent to find Kline
and take him to Cleburne County for a new hearing, but the sources are silent
regarding the final disposition of the case.</p>

      <hr/>
     
      <p><b>Early History</b></p>

<p>County development did not begin in California until after the area came under the
control of the United States. Beginning in the mid 1700s, California was
explored and colonized by Spain, but Mexico's independence from Spain in 1821
resulted in California falling under the authority of Mexico. Settlement was
primarily limited to a narrow area along the Pacific coast, while knowledge of
the interior remained sketchy. During the years of Mexican rule, from 1822 to
1848, Mexico created ranchos, missions, ayuntamientos, and districts, often
with overlapping jurisdictions, to extend civil and religious authority over
the settled parts of California. However, unlike Texas, where the early Mexican
municipalities became the first counties, there is no direct linkage between
the Mexican civil jurisdictions and the original California counties.</p>

<p>One feature of the Mexican period did have an important influence on the development of
county lines—the Mexican land grants, or ranchos. Eight hundred thirteen land
grants were made under Mexican rule, and many of them figure in county boundary
descriptions from the earliest days to the present. While the use of land grant
boundaries suggests a precision in the delineating of county lines, the reality
was often quite different. Rancho boundaries were often vaguely defined, and
most land grants were not actually surveyed until long after their
incorporation in county boundary descriptions. For this project, the surveyed lines
of land grants are used in mapping boundaries, unless other evidence
demonstrates that another line was in actual use.</p>

<p><b>California Statehood</b></p>

<p>Unlike almost all other western states, California never achieved territorial status.
From 1846, when United States troops first landed in California during the
Mexican War, until September 1849 when delegates met to draft a new state
constitution, authority was fragmented among remnants of Mexican civil
bureaucracy, U.S. military rule, and various extralegal endeavors such as the
Bear Flag Revolt. The constitutional convention met in September 1849 in
Monterey, decided to skip the territorial phase, and proceeded directly to
craft a state constitution. Matters then moved quickly, and the state
government went into operation on 20 December 1849 when Peter Burnett was
inaugurated first governor of California. The state legislature also began
meeting in December, although the United States Congress did not officially
admit California to the Union until 9 September 1850.</p>

<p>County creation was one of the most important issues facing the new legislature, and
in February 1850 it passed an act creating twenty-seven counties that covered
all of the state's territory. Thus, except for Mare Island, California had no
&quot;non-county&quot; areas that existed outside the bounds of a county, a
phenomenon that was common to many other states. However, this desire to
establish at least some semblance of government oversight in every corner of
the state did not translate into neat, clear, unambiguous county boundary
lines. Early legislators recognized their lack of geographical knowledge of the
interior, and many of these early interior boundaries were defined in the most
general terms. For example, the northern boundary of Calaveras County was first
described in 1850 as &quot;following the summit of the dividing ridge between
Moquelumne and Cosumne rivers; thence due east to the State boundary line&quot;
(California Laws 1849, 1st sess., ch. 15, sec. 25/p. 63). There was
also a question of whether mining districts should be incorporated into
counties, given their transitory populations. Despite some opposition in the
legislature, the districts were included in the final county creation bill that
was passed on 18 February 1850.</p>

<p>In 1852 California became involved in the first of two county disputes with Nevada.
California proposed Pautah County to be located entirely in present Nevada
(then Utah Territory), contingent upon the United States transferring a large
portion of Utah Territory, including Pautah, to California. That never
occurred, and in 1859 California abandoned efforts to organize Pautah County.</p>

<p>The second dispute was less calculated and due more to lack of information. The boundary
between California and Nevada began to be surveyed in the 1860s, although the
official surveys were not completed until 1873. In 1861, Mono County was
created along the eastern border of California. No one actually knew precisely
where the state line was, and Aurora became the county seat of Mono County.
About the same time Nevada territorial officials made Aurora the county seat of
Esmeralda County, Nevada Territory. Thus Aurora had the distinction of
simultaneously serving as the county seat of two counties located in different
states. In the fall of 1863, the boundary commission reached Aurora and
determined that it lay about three and one-half miles inside Nevada, thus
ending its tenure as county seat of Mono County, California.</p>

<p>The creation of California counties proceeded rapidly, from the twenty-seven
original counties created in 1850 to the creation of California's fifty-eighth
county, Imperial, in 1907. Since that time, no major changes have taken place
in county boundaries, although numerous smaller adjustments have occurred. As
the federal land survey proceeded through California, many of the boundary
changes shifted county lines from less precise features, such as ridge lines or
lines run due east or west from a certain point, to boundaries running on the
federal land survey lines. Most California counties became fully organized
immediately after their creation. This is in contrast to other states where
counties often remained unorganized for years, or even decades. Only four of
the original California counties were unorganized and attached to fully
organized counties: Colusa, Marin, and Trinity for periods of fifteen months or
less; Mendocino for nine years.</p>

<p><b>Twentieth Century Changes in County Boundaries</b></p>

<p>In 1941, the state legislature passed an act that permitted the changing of county
boundaries without going through the legislative process (California Laws 1941,
54th sess., ch. 493/pp. 1801–1805). The boards of supervisors of the
affected counties were allowed to make changes, following strict requirements
set forth in the law. For example, counties were not permitted to move a line
more than five miles, or reduce the size of any county by more than five
percent. Counties were required to file such changes with the Secretary of
State and the State Board of Equalization. The original act of 1941 has been
amended several times and is still in force. The State Board of Equalization
provided a list of some two-dozen boundary changes filed since 1944. Individual
counties were contacted to obtain copies of the relevant ordinances and
resolutions; wherever possible, the changes have been mapped. In a few cases,
detailed information could not be obtained. At the same time laws regarding
county boundaries continued to be passed by the legislature. In some cases,
these simply codified a change already decided between two counties; in other
cases, the legislation appears to be unrelated to local decisions. </p>

<p><b>Small Changes and Proposed Counties</b></p>

<p>Very small changes (indicated by “_pt.shp”) are not mapped on the <i>California
Interactive Map of Historical Counties.</i> However, information on these
changes is provided in the chronologies, which include the date of change,
counties involved, and the source of the information. The locations of most
small changes in California are available as part of the California Tiny
Changes shapefile. (For information about the GIS files see the Atlas of
Historical County Boundaries homepage).</p>

<p>Counties
whose creations were authorized by the legislature, but never took effect, are
known as “proposed” counties. Information on proposed counties is provided in
the chronologies. Proposed counties can be viewed on the interactive map by
activating the “Unsuccessful Proposals” Layer. Proposed changes between
existing counties are not available on the interactive map, but they can be
found in the California Historical Counties shapefile (see the homepage for
more information).</p>

<p><b>Sources</b></p>

<p>California is one of a handful of states for which a well-done county boundary compilation
exists. Owen C. Coy's, <i>California County Boundaries</i> (1923, reprinted
1973), was very useful for this project. This carefully researched work
provides a lot of background information on the "Why" of county
formation and includes information on discussions that took place in
legislative committees, much of which did not result in actual boundary
legislation. The Mexican Land Grant maps in Warren A. Beck and Ynez D. Haase's,
<i>Historical Atlas of California</i> (1974) were helpful for correctly
locating ranchos mentioned in boundary legislation. </p>

<p>Historical maps do not frequently play a large role in these compilations and are treated
as secondary, rather than primary sources. Still, historical maps occasionally
are indispensable for identifying lost landmarks and names of individual
landowners. Important historical maps for California included the forty-two
county landownership maps from the Library of Congress reproduced on
microfiche. Also useful were <i>Topographical Railroad and County Map of the
States of California and Nevada,</i> A. C. Frey and Co. (1868); William M.
Eddy's 1854 <i>Official Map of the State of California</i>; and <i>Britton and
Rey's Map of the State of California,</i> compiled by George H. Goddard (1857)<i>.</i>

<p>Special thanks are due David J. Martin of the California State Board of Equalization
for researching and supplying a list of boundary changes reported to that
office since 1944. Queries to several dozen counties were met with generous
responses. County board members, county administrators, LAFCO officials, and
clerks of the boards of supervisors took time to track down county ordinances
and minutes of board meetings. This work would not be as comprehensive without
their assistance.</p>

      <hr/>
     
      <p>Nearly all American states have defined their counties’
areas and limits as lines running from point to point or along specified
courses. These New England states are exceptions to that practice, for they
commonly defined their counties as groups of towns (incorporated
municipalities). In these states a purposeful change for a county was usually
accomplished by changing the mix of towns that composed it. Each of these
states also altered county areas and bounding lines as the consequence of changing
the lines separating towns on opposite sides of a county boundary; when county
boundaries were changed in this fashion that effect appeared inadvertent and
the affected counties often were never named. The method for discovering such
changes requires identifying neighboring cities and towns that could force a
county change and then searching for changes. For Massachusetts that task was
eased considerably by the Secretary of the Commonwealth’s <i>Historical Data
Relating to Counties, Cities, and Towns in Massachusetts</i> (1966), a
remarkably thorough and accurate listing of jurisdictional changes among
municipalities. A similar collection of data for Maine is <i>Counties, Cities,
Towns, and Plantations of Maine: A Handbook of Incorporations, Dissolutions,
and Boundary Changes</i> (1940), originally compiled and published by the
Historical Records Survey for that state.</p>

      <p>In 1763, as part of the peace agreement that ended the Seven
Years War, France and Great Britain established the northern limit of Maine as
the Atlantic–St. Lawrence River watershed, unchanged since then. Subsequent
disputes over Maine’s boundary concerned not its definition but its
implementation. Therefore, in this atlas the modern version of the boundary
line has been depicted from 1763 onward. Two important changes in Maine were
not clear and obvious from the standard sources. The first case concerned
Aroostook County, which extended across the northern cap of Maine in 1844.
Vague wording in the description of Aroostook’s southern limit could be interpreted
to run the county line through a line of western towns, but that would have
been contrary to the common practice of preserving the integrity of
municipalities, so the county boundary has been plotted along the town lines.
The second case involves the boundary that today separates the town of Detroit
in Somerset County from the town of Plymouth in Penobscot County. In 1790, this
county line ran straight north, cutting through several towns, including
Plymouth. Subsequent laws placed the other towns wholly in one county or the
other. However, there is no extant law that adjusted the line through Plymouth.
An act of 29 February 1844 incidentally mentioned that Detroit and Plymouth
were in different counties and implied that such an arrangement was of long
standing. Lacking other evidence, it appears that years before February 1844
officials and residents had adopted the town lines as the de facto county
lines, so in the chronology that change is dated “by” the date on which the
arrangement was so casually revealed. </p>

      <p><b>Dates</b></p>

      <p>Every effort has been made to give the day, month, and year (e.g., 25 February 1785)
for all county creations, boundary changes, and other events in this atlas.
Occasionally it is impossible to date an event so precisely, but a reasonable
estimate is possible. When the precise date is not known or an approximate date
is more appropriate, the date is generalized to the month and year (e.g.,
February 1785) or to the year alone. A lack of evidence may make it impossible
to give any date at all for a county's creation, and its occurrence can only be
confirmed by the record of a later, related happening, such as the appointment
of a sheriff. In such a situation, the date of the later event is used with the
simple addition of "by" (e.g., by 25 February 1785) to indicate that
the county creation or other event occurred no later than that date and
probably earlier.</p>

      <p>The dating standard in this atlas is the legally effective date of change, whether it be
for the creation of a new county or for the alteration of lines between
existing counties. Through the colonial period and into the nineteenth century,
the date a law passed was generally the date it went into effect. As the
nineteenth century progressed, legislators recognized the importance of
preparing for the establishment of a new county organization or for the shift
in jurisdiction that accompanies boundary changes. Some laws, therefore, began
to carry two dates: one marking the passage of the law and the other specifying
when the line change or new county creation would go into effect. If the date
of passage and effective date are different, the law gives both. Connecticut,
however, is an exception. For every county boundary change in Connecticut
before 1820, the date given here usually marks the beginning of the legislative
session. The sessions were short, dates of passage were not given in the
published records, and the opening date of the session is always available. </p>

      <p>Using effective dates means that many of the dates in this atlas may disagree with
dates in other references. As an aid to appreciating how great the differences
between the two dates can be and to help correlate this data with other
publications, this work gives both the date of passage and the effective date
for all county creations. While the maps are keyed to the effective date, a
notation is made in the chronologies giving the date of passage. For example, a
new county created by a law passed 15 January 1832, which did not take effect
until 1 July 1832, would not be mapped until 1 July. But the chronology would
include the entry: “Act passed 15 January 1832; took effect 1 July 1832.” </p>

      <p>Dating events before 1752 is a problem because the calendar then in use is very
different from the one in use today. Whereas by 1600 most of Europe had adopted
the Gregorian calendar, as the modern system of reckoning the days is called,
England observed the Julian calendar until 2 September 1752. For the purposes
of this atlas, the chief differences between the two systems are, first, numbering
the days and, second, designating the change from one year to the next. There
has been no attempt to convert the dates of one system to those of the other.
Differences in numbering days, therefore, are effectively ignored; whatever day
and month are given in a source are the day and month used here, regardless of
whether the document was written in England or some other country, before or
after 1752. Under the old, Julian calendar the last day of the year was 24
March and the first day was 25 March, which means that in England and its
colonies the day after 24 March 1750 was 25 March 1751. This atlas follows the
convention of showing both years for dates that fall within the period from 1
January through 24 March when the different calendars call for different years.
Thus, successive dates before England's adoption of the Gregorian calendar
would occur as follows: the day after 24 March 1688/1689 would be 25 March
1689; the day after 31 December 1689 would be 1 January 1689/1690. About three
months later would come 24 March 1689/1690, and the next day after that would
be 25 March 1690.</p>

      <p>The territorial period in
the Dakotas was remarkably long and saw numerous changing jurisdictions and
changing geographical configurations. Present North Dakota and South Dakota
were under territorial jurisdiction from 1804, when most of the area first came
under the control of the District of Louisiana (later Louisiana Territory),
until 1889 when statehood was achieved. At various times, parts of the Dakotas
were under the control of Louisiana Territory, Missouri Territory, Michigan
Territory, Wisconsin Territory, Iowa Territory, Minnesota Territory, and
Nebraska Territory. The Missouri and White Earth Rivers often served as an
east-west dividing line separating the area of the modern states into two
distinct territorial jurisdictions. Dakota Territory, at various times,
included parts of present Montana, Nebraska, and Wyoming, and during much of
this time, the area was unorganized federal territory.</p>

      <p>By 1857, it was clear that
Minnesota would soon gain statehood, but the new state would not include the
western part of Minnesota Territory—an area already known by the name “Dakota.”
After the creation in 1854 of Kansas and Nebraska Territories, the United
States Congress moved slowly to establish new territories in the west, despite
growing pressure from settlers, land companies, and railroads to move faster.
The slavery controversy derailed many efforts to create new territories.
Finally, in 1861, after three years of agitation, Congress organized Dakota
Territory, along with Colorado and Nevada Territories. Dakota Territory lasted
an unusually long time, from 1861 until 1889—one entire generation. Because of
the long territorial history, the majority of North Dakota and South Dakota
counties were created by Dakota Territory prior to statehood. Moreover, Dakota
Territory at times covered an area much larger than the bounds of the two
modern states, and the first four counties of Wyoming were created by Dakota
Territory.</p>

      <p>The challenges faced in
mapping historical county boundaries in the Dakotas arise largely from the
vastness of the area and the small population. The surveying of public lands in
the Dakotas began in the 1860s and proceeded in a somewhat slow and piecemeal
fashion, generally moving west from the eastern boundary of the territory.
Often the territorial legislature laid out counties prior to the land being
surveyed, several times writing boundary descriptions that are most difficult
to map.</p>

      <p>In January 1873, Dakota
Territory created sixty-seven counties, leaving only the southwestern and
west-central parts of present South Dakota outside the bounds of a county. Much
of this land had not been surveyed, and in the area west of the Missouri River
and north of forty-seven degrees north latitude, the drawing of county boundary
lines required some interpretation and extrapolation. Today, South Dakota is
covered by survey lines measured west from the fifth principal meridian, and by
lines laid out to the east of the Black Hills meridian (There is also a small
part of southern South Dakota within the limits of the sixth principal
meridian). However, in 1873, territorial officials anticipated guide meridians
forty-two miles apart, or every seven ranges, west of the fifth principal
meridian. In advance of the actual survey they defined some new county lines in
terms of projected 11th and 12th guide meridians that never came into
existence. The compilers, therefore, had to estimate the county boundary lines
of Boreman, Meyer, Pratt, Rusk (now Dewey), and Stanley based on the
legislature’s intent. </p>

      <p>Additional counties created
in this area were defined in terms of latitude and longitude. At the time of
statehood, South Dakota still contained about 24.5 million acres of unsurveyed
public land. It was only in the first two decades of the twentieth century that
all the odd, non-county areas were absorbed into existing counties, and all
county lines were shifted from lines of latitude and longitude to run on
federal land survey lines.</p>

      <p>Over the years, North and
South Dakota have created—and then eliminated—a significant number of counties,
more than any other states. North Dakota currently has fifty-three counties,
but it was also the parent of another seventeen counties that no longer exist,
as well as five more counties that were proposed but never came into existence.
South Dakota, with sixty-six counties, also created another thirty-nine
counties that are now extinct, as well as four unsuccessful proposed counties.
In some cases counties were laid out in anticipation of settlement, but the
actual population never reached sufficient numbers to warrant a fully
functioning county. This collection of data covers all these counties.</p>

      <p>Dakota Territory and its
successor states of North Dakota and South Dakota followed the pattern common
to many Midwest and Plains states of creating counties and then waiting for a
period of time before organizing them. In some cases, the delay was only a
matter of days or weeks, which allowed the new county officials time to prepare
for the task of governing, but in other cases counties remained unorganized for
years, even decades. In general, a county that remained unorganized for a
lengthy period would be attached to a fully organized county for various
governmental purposes. These attachments are all noted in the chronologies. 
In South Dakota, two counties still
have not been organized and are attached to fully organized counties: Shannon
County, which has been in existence since 1875 and is attached to Fall River
County, and Todd County, created in 1909 and now attached to Tripp County.</p>

      <p>Sources do not share a
single standard for determining the date when a county became fully organized.
Sometimes the date when commissioners were appointed was used; in other cases
the date of the first meeting of the county commissioners was cited. Generally,
the difference is small, usually just a matter of days, but in all cases the
particular source is cited in the chronologies.</p>

      <p>Nearly all county boundary
changes and creations in the Dakotas were made through the legislative process.
However, in North Dakota between 1899 and 1912, the state Supreme Court issued
several rulings dealing with county boundaries and creations. These cases
involved the absorption and elimination of counties in the western part of the
state by Billings, Mercer, and Stark Counties. The 1896 act that authorized
these changes was finally ruled unconstitutional in 1901. Other cases involve
the creation of new counties in the first two decades of the twentieth century.
Creations of new counties were, in most cases, dependent on the approval of the
voters living in the affected areas. Challenges to the legality of new-county
referenda delayed the creations of Burke, Golden Valley, Mountrail, and
Renville Counties until the North Dakota Supreme Court upheld the results of
the voting.</p>

      <p>Several sources used to
compile the historical counties of North Dakota and South Dakota merit special
mention. Luella J. Hall’s, “History of the Formation of Counties in North
Dakota,” in volume 5 (1923) of <i>Collections
of the State Historical Society of North Dakota</i>, was very useful. This
carefully done work included not only North Dakota counties, but also counties
in South Dakota created by Dakota Territory. Hall corresponded with local and
state officials, was usually able to determine the outcome of local referenda
on county boundary changes and creations, and in many cases could explain the
reasoning behind certain boundary descriptions.</p>

      <p>The most useful historical
maps were those found in Alfred T. Andreas’, <i>Historical Atlas of 
Dakota</i> (1884). The large-scale individual
county maps in this atlas show great detail and are very accurate. They were
useful for identifying geographical features such as rivers, and for providing
detailed presentations of land survey lines and Indian treaty lines. One other
useful map was the 1878 map of Dakota Territory compiled by the U.S. Engineer
Department. Although it does not include county boundaries, it does show the
extent of the federal land survey to that date, as well as geographical
features. Finally, Hunt and Eaton’s map of North and South Dakota (c.1888) was
particularly useful for county changes west of the Missouri River in the period
just before statehood.</p>

      <p>The Dakotas presented a
particular organizational challenge. Because most of the activity of county
creation and change occurred during the territorial period, because this period
lasted so long, and because it would be historically inaccurate to try to
separate the two states before 1889, the maps and accompanying data are
presented in three parts: Dakota Territory (1804 to 1889), South Dakota (1889
to 2000), and North Dakota (1889 to 2000). This means that to view a North
Dakota county configuration prior to November 1889, one must generally consult
the “Dakota Territory Historical Counties” file. Conversely, while tracing the
county boundary changes of a South Dakota county, one will probably need to
consult both “Dakota Territory Historical Counties” and “South Dakota
Historical Counties.” The exceptions are the counties whose boundaries never
changed and that, therefore, exist in only one version.</p>

      <hr/>
     
      <p>Florida began creating counties
much later than most eastern states; the Spanish and British governors found no
need for sophisticated administrative divisions due to the sparse settlement of
the colony. In 1821, following Spain's cession of East and West Florida to the
United States two years earlier, Andrew Jackson assumed the governorship of the
territory. He retained the division of Florida into eastern and western parts
for administrative purposes, but he moved the dividing line to the Suwannee
River from its earlier location along the Chattahoochee and Appalachicola
Rivers. Jackson decreed that East Florida would be called St. Johns County and
West Florida would be Escambia County. After 1821, county creations and
boundary changes became the responsibility of the legislature.</p>

      <p>Bradford, Brevard, and Orange
Counties had different names when they were created, and Hernando County was renamed
Benton County for six years. In addition, there was an attempt to change the
name of Mosquito (now Orange) County to Leigh Read County. In 1842 the
legislature passed a law changing the name of Mosquito County to Leigh Read, in
honor of the former legislator who was murdered in 1841, the victim of a
longstanding quarrel with the Alston family (Read had killed Augustus Alston in
an 1839 duel after repeated challenges from Alston). Although the bill honoring
Read passed the legislature, a clerk kept the bill from reaching the governor's
desk, effectively killing it. While the change never officially took place, the
name Leigh Read can be found in various documents, including a contemporary
map, as well as in several acts passed by the 1842 Florida territorial
legislature.</p>

      <p>With one exception, Florida
counties were fully organized at the time of creation and remained fully
organized. Dade (now Miami-Dade) County, the lone exception, was created in
1836 with a temporary county seat at Indian Key, about half way between Miami
and Key West. However, the lack of
population created problems from the start. In 1838 one correspondent 
reported that there were not enough men in the
entire county to form a grand and petit jury. Dade's fortunes diminished
further in 1840 when Indians led by Chekika raided Indian Key, killing several
citizens and destroying much of the town. Monroe County began to take over
Dade's duties; in 1851 when the legislature ordered the records and files of
Dade County removed to Monroe, Dade ceased to exist as a fully organized county
and was for all practical purposes attached to Monroe. No single piece of
legislation re-established Dade to fully organized status. Rather, over a
period of time, beginning in the late 1860s, the county government again began
to function, first with the meeting of County Commissioners in September 1869,
then with the appointment of a clerk of court and sheriff, and finally in 1872
with the re-establishment of judicial functions.</p>

      <p>This digital atlas maps the
boundaries of two proposed counties that the Florida legislature tried to
create in the 1910s. The creation of Bloxham County, named for a former
governor, was authorized by the state legislature 1 June 1915, after an
eight-year effort. However, the creation of a new county required the approval
of voters in those portions of Levy and Marion Counties that would compose
Bloxham. Throughout the summer the proposal was hotly debated, and on 14
September 1915, creation of the new county was voted down, 460 to 339. Following
this defeat, no serious efforts were made to revive Bloxham County. In a second
instance, the outcome was different. On 6 June 1913, the Florida legislature
authorized creation of Broward County from Dade County. Dade County voters in
the affected area voted against the proposed county in a referendum. However,
proponents of the new county did not give up, and two years later the
legislature again passed an act authorizing creation of Broward County. This
Broward County covered more territory than the earlier attempt and included
land in Palm Beach County, as well as Dade. This time the referendum passed at
an election held 1 October 1915, and Broward County was organized.</p>

      <p>The boundary between Hernando,
Hillsborough, and Polk Counties presented some especially difficult problems in
the mid-1800s that cannot be definitively resolved. Beginning with Hernando's
creation in 1843, part of its southern boundary with Hillsborough ran along the
Hillsborough River in township 26 south, ranges 21 and 22 east. This part of
the boundary was confirmed on 1 January 1847. On 19 February 1874 Polk was
given all that part of Hillsborough County that lay in township 26 south, so
that Hernando and Polk now shared the boundary along the river in township 26
south, ranges 21 and 22 east. At some point between 1874 and 1883 Hernando
acquired from Polk all of township 26 that lay south of the Hillsborough River,
although there is no legislation to that effect, and research in other local
sources has not identified the reason or source for this change. On 5 March
1883 legislators transferred three sections of the township from Hernando to
Polk; they apparently understood that by that date all of township 26 south,
range 22 east belonged to Hernando. The compiler has decided to use the date
"by 1880" for the transfer of township 26 from Polk to Hernando based
upon the rendering of the boundary on contemporary maps, especially the annual
Rand McNally business atlases which showed a boundary change beginning with the
1880 edition.</p>

      <p><b>Dates</b></p>

      <p>The dating standard in this
digital atlas is the legally effective date of change, whether it is for the
creation of a new county or for the alteration of lines between existing
counties. As the nineteenth century progressed, legislators recognized the
importance of preparing for the establishment of a new county organization or
for the shift in jurisdiction that accompanies boundary changes. Some laws,
therefore, began to carry two dates: one marking the passage of the law and the
other specifying when the line change or new county creation would go into
effect. If the date of passage and effective date are different, the law gives
both.</p>

      <p>Florida counties created before
1858 all have the same passage and effective date. Beginning with the creation
of New River (now Bradford) and Suwannee Counties, many (but not all) counties
had different effective dates—in some cases these dates were established in the
creation act, and in other cases they were dependent on the outcome of a
referendum.</p>

      <p>Suwannee and New River are the
only counties for which a precise effective date is not known. Both counties
were authorized in a single act approved 21 December 1858, but the creations
were dependent on a referendum that was to be held after thirty days public notice
following passage of the act. Neither Bradford, Suwannee, nor the parent
county, Columbia, have county commissioners records from this period, and no
record could be found at the State Archives or in local historical sources. The
earliest possible date for the referendum would have been 20 January 1859, but
because of the time lag in communications, it is more likely that the
referendum would not have been held until February, hence the effective date
"February 1859" used in this digital atlas.</p>

      <p><b>Sources</b></p>

      <p>Most county boundary changes in
Florida are found in the session laws of Florida Territory and the state of
Florida, which were published annually. However, some individuals began to compile
and publish collections of territorial and state laws in the nineteenth
century; some of these works were commissioned or at least sanctioned by the
legislature, and are recognized and accepted as reliable and authoritative. In
Florida John P. Duval's <i>Compilation of the Public Acts of the Legislative
Council of the Territory of Florida Passed Prior to 1840</i> (1839) and Leslie
A. Thompson's <i>Manual or Digest of the Statute Law of the State of Florida,
Including Law of the United States Relative to the Government of Florida</i>
(1847), proved helpful in reconstructing early county boundaries.</p>

      <p>Collections of pertinent
sections of county boundary laws are convenient but demand caution. There is a
potential for error in transcription, as well as the possibility that valuable
information (e.g., an effective date) may be lost in the editorial process of
excerpting the selected passages. Such a compilation can be a marvelous
convenience for the researcher, once it has been checked against the session
laws and has been found reliable. There are compilations of county creations
and changes for a number of states, many prepared by the Historical Records
Survey in the 1930s and 1940s, but they vary greatly in content and in
accuracy. It is virtually impossible to judge their reliability until much of
the work has been replicated. These secondary sources, therefore, are useful
chiefly as guides to the primary laws, proclamations, and decisions. Such a
secondary source is available for Florida, although it is little known. The
Florida Historical Records Survey researched and prepared a compilation of
county boundary laws, but the 1937 typescript was never published. A photocopy
of this work, "Record of Acts of the Legislative Council of the Territory
of Florida and General Assembly of the State of Florida Relating to County
Boundaries, 1821–1937" was acquired from the State Library of Florida and
was used to insure that the compilers' search of session laws was complete.</p>

      <p>Although all works used to
determine the courses of county boundary lines appear in the bibliography,
several deserve special mention. Five volumes of the <i>Territorial Papers of
the United States</i>, covering Florida from 1821–1845, were very important for
identifying locations, people, and survey lines; Charles C. Royce's
"Indian Land Cessions in the United States" (1899) helped determine
the early boundaries of Alachua and Orange Counties, and explained the
re-surveys of the Indian boundary line. Local histories were helpful for
identifying places and confirming referendum dates. Several place name
compilations were also important: <i>Places in the Sun:<span
style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The History and Romance of Florida
Place-Names</i>, by Bertha E. Bloodworth and Alton C. Morris (1978); Howard
Cline's <i>Provisional Historical Gazeteer [sic], with Locational Notes on
Florida Colonial Communities, 1700–1823, and 16 Maps, 3 Figures</i> (1964.
Reprint 1974); and Allen Morris's <i>Florida Place Names</i> (1974).</p>

      <p><b>Maps</b></p>

      <p>Historical maps are generally
treated as secondary works, used to locate lost landmarks and names, but sometimes
errors on old maps can benefit research. When a boundary description cannot be
plotted on a modern base map or does not seem to make sense, the flaw may lie
not in the description but in the geographic notions upon which it was based.
If the errors on an old map accurately reflect accepted ideas and knowledge,
however mistaken they may have been, that map may be the key to the true
meaning of contemporaneous boundary descriptions. Florida provides an excellent
example of this. In the 1820s and 1830s the southern interior of Florida was
still largely unknown and unexplored. When Monroe County was created in 1823
the northern boundary was described as a line running east from Charlotte
Harbor up the Charlotte River to Lake Macaco (now Lake Okeechobee). The problem
is that no river runs from Lake Okeechobee to Charlotte Harbor. Given the
swampy conditions and difficult terrain, it is not surprising that such a
mistake was made. John Williams wrote of the area in 1837: "Macaco, or
Charlotte River, is supposed to have its source in Myacco Lake [Lake
Okeechobee], in the heart of the Peninsula. We have not been so fortunate as to
find white man or Indian that had ever visited the lake or the river more than
fifty or sixty miles above Charlotte Bay" (<i>Territory of Florida…</i>,
49). In fact, on a map Williams drew to accompany his book, he included a
Macaco River, but left out Lake Okeechobee. I. G. Searcy's 1829 map of Florida
shows Charlotte River running from Lake Okeechobee to Charlotte Harbor,
although the lake is placed southwest of its actual location. In this case, the
early, erroneous maps are essential to understanding the information available
to legislators, and a line can be drawn to approximate the intended boundary.</p>

      <p>The historical maps most
frequently consulted for roads, rivers, lakes, and other locations were I. G.
Searcy's <i>Map of Florida Constructed Principally from Authentic Documents in
the Land Office at Tallahassee</i> (1829); the maps accompanying John
Williams's two books, <i>Territory of Florida…</i> (1837) and <i>View of West
Florida…</i> (1827); U. S. Engineer Department, <i>Map of the Seat of War in
Florida…</i> (1839); J. Goldsborough Bruff, <i>State of Florida, Compiled in
the Bureau of Topographical Engineers from the Best Authorities</i> (1846); and
<i>Atlas of Florida… </i>(1926. Reprint 1980).</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In addition to the state’s session laws and
constitutions—the standard authoritative sources for each state’s county
creations and changes—the Office of the Secretary of State in Georgia has
produced a number of historical research aids and copies of original sources
that were important to the success of the research and compilation of Georgia
data for the Atlas of Historical County Boundaries. Foremost is Georgia
Counties: Their Changing Boundaries, compiled by Pat Bryant in 1977 and revised
by Ingrid Shields in 1983. The county-by-county lists of the gains and losses
of territory from other counties, together with dates of change and citations
to the legal authorities for the changes, provided a standard against which
atlas staff checked their research in the Georgia laws and other sources.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Next to Bryant’s compilation of boundary laws, the most
valuable sources were electronic materials available through the Internet. The
Office of the Secretary of State has digitized and posted to the Internet a
mass of primary source material under the rubric “Georgia’s Virtual Vault:
Digital Treasures from the Georgia Archives”
(http://content.sos.state.ga.us/cdm4/dmf.php). The most useful sets of data
from this collection were “County Maps” (manuscript maps, nearly all from
official surveys in the late 1860s), “Historical Maps” (early printed maps of
the state), and “District Plats of Survey” (manuscript plots of the original
land lot surveys). An additional trove of historical material in electronic
form is available through the Digital Library of Georgia, particularly
“GeogiaInfo” (http://georgiainfo.galileo.usg.edu), put out by the Carl Vinson
Institute of Government at the University of Georgia. Most useful was the
section on “Georgia Maps,” especially the subset called the “Historical Atlas
of Georgia Counties.” This digital “atlas” provided maps showing each county
and its vicinity excerpted from printed maps of Georgia published in different
years from the 1770s into the 2000s; the listing of those maps in the citations
and bibliography of this Alas of Historical County Boundaries follows the style
used to identify them in “GeorgiaInfo.”</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Dating Changes 1881-2000<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>In 1877 Georgia adopted a new constitution that included a
provision prohibiting future alterations of county lines without a general law
to control the process. A general boundary law went into effect in 1881,
replacing the practice of legislating each boundary change with a general
requirement that affected counties must agree among themselves on any line
changes; such agreement would be sufficient to modify their mutual boundary.
Unfortunately, that general law (still in effect in 2010) did not require the
counties involved in the locally arranged boundary changes to report their
results to the state government. From then on there was no systematic,
centralized, authoritative record of changes in Georgia’s county network, and
it proved impractical to ascertain the precise date of every change that could
be found.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Atlas staff dealt with that situation by comparing each
county as it was in 1881 to its shape and location on later, more modern maps,
including official state road maps, the federal maps used as bases for
compilation, the maps in the state’s online historical atlas, and the
large-scale individual county maps that the project was able to acquire from
the county surveyors’ offices. If the modern map retained the shape from 1881,
that indicated there had been no change.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>If there was a difference, a review of available maps usually uncovered
a brief period—the years between maps that displayed different versions of the
boundary—when the change was most likely to have occurred. The change was then dated
as having happened “by” the end of that period, that is the publication year
for the map that first showed the change.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Judging from the many differences between Hudgins’ Map of Georgia (1915)
and the Georgia State Highway Department’s “Official 1952 Georgia Highway Map,”
nearly forty counties experienced mappable boundary changes between 1915 and
1952; all those changes had to be dated ”by 31 December 1952”.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Comparing Descriptions of Changes<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whenever a reader finds that a description of change in this
atlas disagrees with Pat Bryant’s Georgia Counties, the source of that
disagreement most likely will be the difference between a detailed mapping of
the boundary description and the stated intention of the law. Many county
boundary laws open with a statement of the intended result of the law. As
happened in every other state of the Union, those statements occasionally were
rendered incomplete or inaccurate by various factors, including clerical errors
and geographic ignorance among Georgia’s lawmakers, due chiefly to a lack of
reliable, detailed maps for reference when composing boundary descriptions. The
verbal boundary description in the law is the authoritative version of a county
boundary, even if it does not accomplish the law’s stated intention. Anyone
trying to summarize the impact of a law (e.g., A gained from B and C) either
must rely upon the law’s statement of its anticipated effect or must examine
detailed maps of the boundary before and after the change. Because Pat Bryant
did not plot the boundary lines detailed in the laws she compiled for Georgia
Counties: Their Changing Boundaries lines—and because she had no
before-and-after maps, her principal recourse was the statements of purpose in
the laws. As a result, for any given boundary event, this project’s description
of a change may not match the one in Georgia Counties. For example, the law
that created Fanin County on 21 January 1854 said the new county was being
formed from Gilmer and Union and did not mention Murray, from which Fanin initially
took its westernmost range of land lots. Lacking any alternative source,
Bryant’s book echoes the law and credits territorial contributions from Gilmer
and Union only, whereas this atlas says that all three counties contributed to
Fanin’s creation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>Georgia’s Land Surveys<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Starting with the two parcels of land ceded by the Indians
to the national government in 1802 and shortly thereafter transferred to the
state, Georgia inaugurated a system of organizing and surveying the land before
distributing it to settlers through a lottery. (Lotteries were held in seven
different years during the period 1803-1832; they accounted for about two
thirds of the state, roughly all land west of the Oconee River.) Georgia
created a small number of large, named counties within each land cession, then
divided those counties into numbered land districts and further subdivided the
districts into square land lots. The numbers identifying lots were repeated
from district to district; in like fashion, the numbers identifying districts
in one county were repeated for districts in the next county. Although
comparable in principle to the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) employed by the
federal government to organize and distribute the land it acquired from the
Indians outside the original thirteen states, Georgia’s system lacked
uniformity in details. There was notable variation from one cession to another
in the sizes, shapes, and orientations of the districts and, to a lesser
extent, in the sizes of the land lots. Nonetheless, it should be no surprise
that, over time, the lawmakers who created and refined the county network in
the land-lottery region based more and more of their boundary descriptions on
the land lots and their districts, similar to the way boundary makers in areas
organized under the PLSS described their counties.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Until very recently, there was no state-wide map or other
comprehensive representation of the land districts and lots; that made it
difficult to map the boundary changes specified in the session laws. This
project sent requests for land lot maps to all the counties west of the Oconee
River, and a large majority of those counties obliged with large-scale maps
from their surveyors. It appeared that digitizing would be at least as
difficult as plotting the historical lines until March 2010, not long after
digitizing had commenced, when the Newberry Library acquired “Georgia Land
Lots”—that is, a donated copy of rGa and Associates’ recently finished
cartographic database of all Georgia land lots and districts—to use as a
reference base for digitizing the old county lines. Without the generosity of
rGa and the counties that furnished maps, compiling and digitizing Georgia’s
historical counties would have been nigh impossible.</p>

      <hr/>
     
      <p><b>Before Statehood</b></p>

      <p>The land within the present
state of Iowa was part of the Louisiana Purchase, acquired in 1803 from France.
In 1804, it was incorporated into the District of Louisiana, which was attached
to Indiana Territory. Subsequently present Iowa was part of Louisiana Territory
(1805–1812) and Missouri Territory (1812–1821). It became unorganized federal
territory when Missouri became a state in 1821, and continued so until it
became part of Michigan Territory in 1834. In 1836 present Iowa was
incorporated into Wisconsin Territory and remained there until 3 July 1838,
when Iowa Territory was created from Wisconsin Territory. The state of Iowa was
created on 28 December 1846, with its present boundaries. The maps in this
digital atlas show all of the county configurations under these various
jurisdictions. </p>

      <p><b>Iowa’s County Boundaries</b></p>

      <p>The land that became the
state of Iowa was once part of the national public domain and, as such, was
divided for sale according to the federal rectangular survey system. Although
some of the earliest county creations and boundary changes in present Iowa were
based on river systems and arbitrary lines, lawmakers quickly recognized the
utility of basing boundaries on the survey system. Thus the Missouri
territorial legislature began incorporating range and township lines into
county boundary descriptions early in its governance of present Iowa, and that
practice has been continued by subsequent governing bodies. The lines laid down
by those early land surveyors are still in use and remain a prominent and
important feature of the modern maps used to make this atlas. Given the persistence
of the survey lines and their appearance on modern federal maps, plotting
county lines based on the land survey is easier and more precise than working
with metes and bounds descriptions that depend on ridge lines, river systems,
and local landmarks.</p>

      <p>A few boundary lines cannot
be precisely drawn. Some involve natural features or local landmarks that are
difficult to locate, while a few reflect the vagueness and imprecision of the
laws on which they are based. Occasionally a boundary line cannot be drawn as
described, due to some oversight or error in the legislation or typographical
error in the printed statute. The legislature's intent is usually apparent in
other provisions of the law in question or in later boundary changes, and in
these cases the intent of the law—rather than a rigid interpretation of the
text—has been followed.</p>

      <p>The Iowa state constitution
of 1857 (still in effect, as amended) stipulates that no new county can be
created containing less than 432 square miles and that no existing county can
be reduced below that size by boundary changes. The 1857 constitution exempted
from these requirements Worth County and the counties west of Worth along the
Minnesota border, which had been created in 1851 and were smaller than 432
square miles: Bancroft (eliminated in 1855), Dickinson, Emmet, Osceola, and
Winnebago (Art. XI, sec. 2). The constitution of 1846 also had the
432-square-mile requirement, but no one challenged the constitutionality of the
six counties created in 1851. An 1844 draft constitution, which accompanied
Iowa Territory's application for statehood and which was rejected by the
voters, would have required a county minimum of 400 square miles. Both the 1846
and 1857 constitutions required that all boundary changes between existing
counties be approved by the voters of each affected county in a general
election. In practice, very few boundary changes were submitted to the voters
for approval; the legislature usually altered the boundaries of existing
counties by simply defining or redefining the county boundaries.</p>

      <p>Two cases involving these
constitutional provisions were ultimately decided by the Iowa State Supreme
Court. In 1860 the court voided an 1858 act transferring four townships from
Webster County to Humboldt County because the transfer had not been submitted
to the voters for approval. The 1857 act re-creating Humboldt had, through a
printing error, failed to include the four townships in Humboldt. An 1858
"explanatory" act had corrected the error, but the court ruled that
it was an "independent" act and did "not relate back" to
the 1857 law. Thus, according to the constitution of 1857, it was subject to
voter approval. The four townships therefore reverted to Webster County.</p>

      <p>In the second case, an 1871
ruling, the court found the 1870 creation of Crocker County unconstitutional.
Crocker was created from Kossuth County with the same, identical boundaries as
Bancroft County, which was eliminated in 1855. While Crocker contained only 408
square miles, it was equal in size to Worth and the five counties west of Worth
(including the now-extinct Bancroft County) exempted from the constitutional
minimum of 432 square miles. The court ruled that Worth and the counties west
of it could be organized with no additional territory, but that no <i>new
county</i> could be created with an area less than 432 square miles. Crocker
was considered a new county and, therefore, not constitutionally acceptable.</p>

      <p>In 1862 the legislature
provided for local initiative in altering county boundaries. If at least
one-half of the legal voters in each of the affected counties petitions their
county board of supervisors for a change, the proposed change must be presented
for a vote at the next general election. If a majority of the voters in each
affected county approve, the boundary change takes effect on the first Monday
of January following the election. Another law, approved in 1864, allows local
residents to rename their county. If one-fifth of the county's legal voters
petition their board of supervisors for a name change, the supervisors propose
a name, which the voters consider at the next general election.</p>

      <p>Prior to Iowa statehood in
1846, both the Wisconsin and Iowa territorial legislatures immediately
“attached” newly-created counties to fully organized counties, but beginning in
1846 Iowa frequently left counties "unorganized" at creation. At a
later date, the legislature either attached them to an organized county or
fully "organized" them (i.e., made provisions for county government).
In 1847 the state legislature extended the procedure for organizing
Pottawattamie County to all unorganized counties: whenever the judge of the
judicial district in which an unorganized county was located deemed that the
"public good" required that the county be organized, he could order a
special election to select the first county officers. An 1853 law provided that
an unorganized county could be organized when a majority of the legal voters of
an unorganized county petitioned the county judge of the county to which the unorganized
county was attached, and the judge, in turn, was required to order the election
of the first county officers.</p>

      <p>The process by which
unorganized territory was attached to organized counties changed over time,
could last for a period of several months to several years, and contained many
ambiguities. Furthermore, the precise nature of the attachments is not always
clear; in some cases the unorganized area was simply "attached" to an
existing county, but in other instances the attachments were "for
temporary purposes," "for judicial purposes," or "for
election, revenue, and judicial purposes." While it is beyond the scope of
this project to define the precise meaning of each phrase, the variations in
terminology may be important to researchers. Therefore, when the purpose of the
attachment is stated in the law, it is included in both the consolidated
chronology and the individual county chronology in quotation marks (e.g.,
"for judicial purposes"). In cases where the law gives no specific
purpose for the attachment, the phrase <i>for administrative and judicial
purposes</i> is used without quotation marks.</p>

      <p>These different approaches
to creating, attaching, and organizing counties are reflected in the fact that
only 16 (including the re-created Humboldt County) of Iowa's present 99
counties were fully organized at creation and were never attached to another
county. Of the remaining 83 counties, 63 were attached to another county at
some point (17 at creation and 46 subsequent to creation). The other 20 counties
were not fully organized at creation but were subsequently organized without
ever being attached to another county.</p>

      <p>Although territorial and
state officials generally respected Indian rights to the land and often
incorporated Indian boundary lines in county boundaries, as early as 1837 the
Wisconsin territorial legislature extended county lines in present Iowa to the
western limits of the territory. It thus anticipated the migration of
non-Indian settlers into the region well before the Sioux tribes ceded the last
Indian lands in northwestern and north-central Iowa in 1851. In this digital
atlas, the county boundaries are drawn as described in the laws, with due
regard to the Indian boundary lines when they were part of the boundary
description—but with no recognition of the gradual purchase of Indian lands by
territorial and state officials.</p>

      <p>A boundary dispute between
Iowa and Missouri was ultimately settled by the United States Supreme Court in
1849. Missouri precipitated the controversy in 1838 when it expanded its Clark
County north of the line commonly accepted as the boundary since 1820—the
modern boundary, known since 1816 as the "Old Indian Boundary" or
"Sullivan line." Missouri's 1838 encroachment overlapped just a small
part of Iowa's Van Buren County, but in 1839 Missouri enlarged the area by
claiming a strip of land, approximately ten miles wide, north of the present
boundary, between the Des Moines and Missouri Rivers.</p>

      <p>In 1846 Congress referred
the boundary dispute to the United States Supreme Court. The dispute hinged on
the location of the "rapids" of the Des Moines River, from which
point the northern boundary of Missouri was to run due west and to
"correspond with the Indian boundary line"—according to the Missouri
constitution of 1820. In arguing its case before the Supreme Court in 1847,
Missouri located the "rapids" of the Des Moines River approximately
ten miles north of the present boundary. Iowa contended that the
"rapids," as they were commonly recognized in 1820, were in the
Mississippi River—not the Des Moines River. Iowa's interpretation put the
boundary approximately seven miles south of the present line. In its decision
of 13 February 1849, the Supreme Court rejected both claims, asserting that
there were no actual rapids in the Des Moines River, and dismissing as
untenable Iowa's claim that the rapids in question were in the Mississippi
River. Instead, the Court chose the Indian boundary line run and marked by John
C. Sullivan in 1816, which was the commonly accepted boundary before the
dispute arose and which remains the present boundary between the two states.</p>

      <p>In this digital atlas, only
the 1838 overlap of Van Buren County, Iowa by Clark County, Missouri is mapped,
since the boundaries of the overlap are clearly defined in a Missouri law.
However, the county overlaps implicit in Missouri's definition of its northern
boundary in 1839 and in the boundaries advocated by the two states before the
United States Supreme Court in 1847 are not mapped because the proposed
boundaries were never extended to the county level. These "implicit"
overlaps are covered in the chronologies only.</p>

      <p>Most Iowa laws creating new
counties or altering the boundaries between existing counties took effect upon
passage of the law. In some cases an effective date was stated in the law, and
after 1855 some laws took effect after they were published in two state
newspapers (named in the law). Organization dates (i.e., the date, after
creation, when a county became fully operational and independent) for Iowa counties
are taken from two sources. Forty-two counties were organized by statute,
either at creation (16) or at a later date (26). The other 57 were organized
under the judicial procedures outlined in the 1847 and 1853 election laws.
Organization dates for those 57 counties are taken from Jacob A. Swisher,
"Organization of Counties": organization dates for 49 counties use
the date of the county's first official business; dates for 6 counties
(Dickinson, Emmet, Hardin, Monona, Sac, and Story) are the election of the
first county officers; and dates for the counties of Sioux and Winnebago are
approximate, since Swisher could find no specific date of organization.</p>

      <p>Illinois land was once part of the
      national public domain and, as such, was divided for sale
      according to the federal rectangular survey system. Although the
      earliest county creations and boundary changes in present
      Illinois were based principally on river systems and extended
      arbitrary lines, lawmakers quickly recognized the utility of
      basing boundaries on the survey system. Thus the Illinois
      territorial legislature began incorporating range, township, and
      section lines into county boundary descriptions early in its
      tenure, and the state legislature continued the practice. The
      lines laid down by those early land surveyors are still in use
      and remain a prominent and important feature of the modern maps
      used to make this atlas. Given the persistence of the survey
      lines and their appearance on modern federal maps, plotting
      county lines based on the land survey is easier and more precise
      than working with metes and bounds descriptions that depend on
      ridge lines, river systems, and local landmarks.</p>

      <p>A few boundary lines cannot be precisely
      drawn. Some involve natural features or local landmarks
      difficult to locate, while a few reflect the vagueness and
      imprecision of the laws on which they are based. These uncertain
      boundaries are identified by "estimated line" and "indefinite limit,"
      respectively. Occasionally a boundary line cannot be drawn as
      described, due to some oversight or error in the legislation or
      typographical error in the printed statute. The legislature's
      intent is usually apparent, however, in other provisions of the
      law in question or in later boundary changes, and in these cases
      the intent-rather than a rigid interpretation-of the law has
      been followed.</p>

      <p>For example, when Fayette County was
      created on 14 February 1821, it was to include all territory
      north of its prescribed southern boundary. It is clear, however,
      that the legislature intended Fayette to extend north only to
      the Illinois River, not to the state boundary with Wisconsin,
      since Pike County (created on 31 January 1821) covered all of
      Illinois north of the Illinois River. A literal interpretation
      of the statute creating Fayette, then, would split Pike in
      two-an interpretation clearly at odds with future boundary
      changes. Also, a provision of the statute creating Cook County
      in 1831 cannot be mapped. The law directs that all territory
      north of Cook's northern boundary (defined as the state line
      with Wisconsin), to the Rock River, be attached to Cook
      County. In 1831 there was no territory in Illinois north of Cook
      County (the Illinois-Wisconsin boundary was established in
      1818), and thus the legislature's intent is unclear.</p>

      <p>The General Assembly's first restriction
      on creation of new counties was enacted in 1827, when it
      directed that existing counties could be divided only on
      petition of a majority of the county's qualified voters. In 1845
      the legislature further required that all new counties contain
      at least 400 square miles, that existing counties not be reduced
      below 400 square miles by boundary changes, and that altered
      boundary lines must be at least 10 miles from the county seats
      of existing counties.</p>

      <p>The state constitution of 1848
      incorporated the provisions of the 1827 and 1845 laws, and also
      required that all boundary changes be approved by a majority of
      the voters of the affected areas. Beginning in 1837, the
      legislature had submitted many boundary changes to the voters
      for approval, so the constitutional requirement made mandatory
      what had up to that time been common practice. This democratic
      approach to creating counties is reflected in the fact that
      twenty-six proposed creations were submitted to the voters for
      approval between 1837 and 1867. The voters approved thirteen
      (Bureau, Cass, DeKalb, Douglas [on second attempt], Ford,
      Hardin, Jersey, Kankakee [on second attempt], Pulaski, Richland,
      Saline [twice], and Williamson), and rejected thirteen (Allen,
      Audubon, Benton, Coffee, Douglas [on first attempt], Harrison,
      Holmes, Kankakee [on first attempt], Lincoln, Michigan, Milton,
      Okaw, and Oregon). Voters also rejected fifteen proposed
      boundary changes between existing counties. The constitution of
      1870 continued the provisions of the 1848 constitution, while
      the 1970 state constitution simply states that all county
      boundary changes must be approved by the voters of the affected
      counties.</p>

      <p>A prolonged controversy over the creation
      of Saline County was eventually settled by the state supreme
      court. Saline was created from Gallatin County, by referendum,
      in August 1847. However, a bitter legal contest over the
      location of Gallatin's county seat finally induced the
      legislature, in 1851, to abolish both Gallatin and Saline
      counties and to combine the territory of the two counties into a
      "new" county named Gallatin. The state supreme court declared
      the creation of the "new" county unconstitutional on the grounds
      that the voters of Gallatin and Saline had not approved the
      change, as required by the state constitution. The legislature
      responded by providing for a referendum on the creation of the
      "new" Gallatin County in August 1852. The voters rejected the
      proposal, and Saline County was thereby resurrected.</p>

      <p>In 1873 the General Assembly essentially
      made county boundary changes a local matter. It required that
      all changes involving more that one-half township (i.e., 18
      sq. mi.) could only be initiated on petition by a majority of
      the legal voters in the area to be transferred, to the county
      officials of the two affected counties. County officials were
      then required to hold an election within three months, and if
      the voters in each affected county approved the boundary change,
      the election result was to be reported to the secretary of state
      and the change took effect on 1 March following the
      election. When the area petitioned to be transferred was less
      than one-half township, the county officials could-at their
      discretion-either reject the petition or hold the required
      election. All of these basic provisions were included in the
      Revised Statutes of the State of Illinois, 1885.</p>

      <p>Many counties were created in Illinois
      before there was adequate population to support them. The
      legislature therefore devised a system of attachments, whereby
      newly created counties were attached to existing counties for
      varying terms and purposes. The process by which unorganized
      territory was attached to existing counties changed over time
      and contained many ambiguities. Furthermore, the precise nature
      of the attachment is not always clear: in some laws the
      unorganized area was simply "attached" to an existing county,
      but in other cases the attachments were "for county purposes,"
      "for all judicial and other purposes," or "for all judicial and
      other county purposes." </p>

      <p>The earliest attachments, 1818-1823, were
      the least complicated. The legislature simply directed that the
      attached area (generally non-county or unorganized territory)
      was to remain attached to the host county until formed into a
      separate county or "otherwise disposed of" by the General
      Assembly. However, beginning with the creation of Hancock,
      Mercer, and Warren counties in 1825, the legislature frequently
      required that new counties have at least 350 inhabitants before
      a circuit court judge could authorize elections for the first
      county officers. In 1836, when Kane, McHenry, Ogle, Winnebago,
      and Whiteside were created, the law required that the counties
      prove-by petition to a circuit court judge-that they contained
      at least 350 "white inhabitants" before elections could be
      held. This population requirement superseded any dates for
      organizing counties included in the text of the laws.</p>

      <p>The statutes creating Boone (1837),
      DeKalb (1837), DeWitt (1839), Kane (1836), Livingston (1837),
      Ogle (1836), Stephenson (1837), and Winnebago (1836) "attached"
      them to existing counties, but it is clear from other provisions
      of the statutes that the period of attachment was merely the
      time required to set the new counties in motion. In each case,
      the statute creating the county also set the date for the
      election of the first county officers-usually several months
      after formal creation. In this volume, these counties are not
      defined as being attached.</p>

      <p>Of the ten Illinois counties attached to
      existing counties at creation, seven were later detached (i.e.,
      "organized") by separate statutes: Effingham, Jasper, McHenry,
      Mercer, Rock Island, Warren, and Whiteside. For the others
      (Iroquois, McDonough, and Hancock), the statute creating them
      authorized a circuit court judge to order elections for the
      first county officers when each had at least 350 inhabitants. In
      these cases, in the absence of a specific statute of
      organization, the compilers have used the date of the elections
      for the first county officers as the date each was detached
      (i.e., "organized"). Henry and Knox counties, although not
      attached to existing counties at their creation, were also
      required to have a population of 350 and thus had their
      organization dates as functioning counties delayed
      considerably.</p>

      <hr/>
     
      <p>The early development of Indiana's county boundaries was
heavily influenced by the initial presence and subsequent removal of the
Indians. The federal Ordinances of 1785 and 1787 required territorial
governments to respect Indian title to the land. Settlers were not to extend
their settlements, or their counties, into Indian territory. Nevertheless, the
Northwest Territory and Indiana Territory created counties that encroached on
Indian tribal lands. The situation had changed by the time of statehood in
1816, and the issue of Indian land ownership severely constrained county
development in the state, where Indian treaty lines often became county
boundaries.</p>

      <p>In the early years, each new land cession from the Indians
was organized into a separate, fully operational county (Ripley County was the
one exception, remaining unorganized for over a year). This pattern changed in
1820 when two pseudo-counties were created for the New Purchase, a tract of
5,800 square miles in central Indiana that had been acquired from the Miami and
Potawatomi in 1818 by the Treaty of St. Mary's. These counties were designated
Delaware New Purchase (renamed Adams New Purchase in 1827) and Wabash New
Purchase. At no time did they exist as independent, fully organized counties
and, although little is known about the thinking behind their establishment, it
appears that the state legislature never intended to let them develop in the
usual manner. They were almost immediately subdivided into various parts that
were attached to fully organized counties. These attachments shifted
frequently, creating a crazy-quilt pattern of jurisdictions, until by 1845 all
of the New Purchase had been absorbed into organized counties. </p>

      <p>All Indiana counties but one were established by statute or
by proclamation of the territorial governor; the exception is Newton County.
Newton was originally created by statute on 7 February 1835 and attached to
Jasper County, but it failed to attract enough settlers and was incorporated
into Jasper in 1839. Taking advantage of an 1857 act (repealed 1861) &quot;to
authorize the formation of new counties&quot; outside the control of the state
legislature, residents of the western half of Jasper started a movement for a
new county. On 27 February 1858, the Jasper County Board of Commissioners
accepted a recommendation to re-establish Newton County. Litigation ensued, and
the effective date of Newton's establishment was delayed until 8 December 1859
when the Indiana Supreme Court upheld the action of the commissioners.</p>

      <p>Another attempt to put control of county changes in local
hands is Public Law number 212, passed 27 February 1980 and still in effect,
which established a procedure for altering county boundaries without going
through the state legislature. County surveyors were required to file with the
Indiana Secretary of State accurate legal descriptions of their counties as of
31 August 1981 and to report any later alterations within 30 days of the
effective date of change. Apparently the county lines have remained stable
because no changes were reported to the Secretary of State's office between 31
August 1981 and 1990.</p>

      <p>One clarification emerged from those 1981 county surveyors'
reports. The surveyors of St. Joseph, Marshall, and Fulton Counties all
incorporated the Michigan Road Lands into their boundary descriptions. Earlier
descriptions in the revised statutes and state codes referred only to the
township, range, and section lines of the federal land survey and completely
ignored these lands, but it appears the layout of the Michigan Road Lands had a
slight effect on the northern and southern boundaries of Marshall and,
therefore, on its abutters, St. Joseph and Fulton. The Michigan Road was to run
from Lake Michigan to the Wabash River, and land for it was acquired in 1826 by
treaty with the Potawatomi. The land between South Bend and Logansport was
surveyed, but the lines of the road survey never matched the township, range,
and section lines of the federal land survey in the surrounding area. In 1831
the surveys and plats of the Michigan Road Lands were completed, the first land
sales were held, and road construction began. As Marshall's northern and
southern lines were being marked, when the surveyors crossed the Michigan Road
they did not make extensions of the federal land survey lines but instead
changed course slightly and followed the existing lines of the 1831 road
survey.  The boundaries of these counties were mapped according to the 1831
road survey.</p>

      <hr/>
     
      <p><b>Kentucky Boundaries</b></p>

      <p>Kentucky was a
part of Virginia until 1792, and Virginia established the process of creating
new counties in Kentucky. Beginning in 1735, present Kentucky was included, in
turn, as part of Orange, Augusta, Botetourt, and Fincastle Counties; then in
1776 it was set aside as a separate county. Thereafter, as population
increased, new counties were created by dividing existing counties. Until 1891
there were no constitutional barriers to the creation of new counties.</p>

      <p>The current state
constitution (1891) sharply limits the creation of new counties and the
alteration of county lines: new counties must contain at least 400 square
miles; no counties can be reduced below 400 square miles by such creations; the
boundary lines of new counties must be at least 10 miles from the county seats
of the counties from which they are taken; new counties and the counties from
which they are taken must have at least 12,000 inhabitants; and a county cannot
lose territory to another unless a majority of its voters approve the change.</p>

      <p>The effect on
county boundary changes was dramatic. Whereas there were twelve boundary
changes approved by the legislature at its last biennial session (1889–1890)
before the 1891 constitution took effect, there was not another change until
Beckham County was created on 9 February 1904. However, Beckham survived only
until 29 April 1904, when the state Court of Appeals abolished the county
because it contained less than the constitutionally required 400 square miles
(and its creation reduced Carter County to less than that) and because its
boundaries ran less than ten miles from the county seats of Carter and Lewis Counties.
Earlier, in 1867, the legislature approved the creation of Henrietta County
from Marshall and Trigg Counties, provided that the voters of Trigg approved.
They voted against it, however, and Henrietta never came into being.</p>

      <p>Several Kentucky
boundary descriptions were especially difficult to interpret. In the 1780s and
1790s a number of county creations hinged on an interpretation of the
"middle" or "main" fork of the Kentucky River. Although the
creation of Fayette in 1780 involves the "middle" fork, subsequent
creations refer to the "main" fork or the existing boundary; in 1800,
however, the "main" fork is by implication the North Fork (in the
creation of Floyd). From 1780 to 1800, therefore, the "main" fork is
interpreted here to mean the Middle Fork; from the creation of Floyd in 1800
onward, the North Fork is interpreted as the "main" fork. John
Filson, on his 1784 map of Kentucky, clearly identified the South, Middle, and
North Forks of the Kentucky River, so contemporaries were presumably familiar
with those distinctions.</p>

      <p>Another mapping
problem involves a part of Ohio County added to Breckinridge County in 1831.
The law effecting the change directs that the new boundary run up Pipe Run,
whereas the effective boundary has apparently been Pond Run, a neighboring
stream, from 1831 to the present. The compilers have found no law switching the
boundary from Pipe to Pond Run, nor any explanation as to why the switch was
made.</p>

      <p>The many boundary
adjustments, clarifications, and redefinitions reflect the fact that for much
of Kentucky's history, counties were created against a backdrop of rapidly
expanding population and often inadequate geographical knowledge. For other
reasons, as well, some imprecision in drawing historical county boundaries in
Kentucky is inevitable. The laws frequently direct that boundaries run along
mountain ridges, between river systems, and to the "head" of a river
or stream—directions somewhat vague and imprecise. Also, boundaries often
involve landmarks that cannot be identified today, e.g., the property of named
individuals, roads, water fords, ferries, mills, and river landings. Finally,
some boundaries were ephemeral, disappearing completely in later boundary
changes and sometimes in existence for only a brief time. Judging by the many
boundary disputes and the stated reasons for specific boundary changes, it is
also apparent that many county boundaries were not surveyed and clearly marked.
A particular problem was posed by boundary changes made for the convenience of
named individuals, with little or no geographic clues as to their location.
Most of these changes are unmapped in this work; in the chronologies they are
identified as "small area (areas)" transferred "to accommodate
local property owner (owners)."</p>

      <p><b>Sources</b></p>

      <p>Virtually all
boundary changes in Kentucky, from its earliest days when it was part of
Virginia to the present, have been made by the legislature. The laws approved
by the Virginia legislature before 1792 are collected in 13 volumes of William
Waller Hening’s, <i>Statutes at Large; Being a Collection of All the Laws of
Virginia…</i>, published between 1819 and 1823. Beginning with 1792, the state
session laws, <i>Acts of the General Assembly for the Commonwealth of Kentucky</i>,
are available in printed volumes and microform. Hening does not include the
dates of passage for laws approved before 1787; in this work, those dates are
taken from Morgan Poitiaux Robinson’s, <i>Virginia Counties </i>(1916). Harry
Toulmin’s, <i>A Collection of all the Public and Permanent Acts of the General
Assembly of Kentucky…</i>(1802), contains a handy summary of early county
creations and boundary changes, but it has errors and should be used with
caution.</p>

      <p>Collections of
pertinent sections of county boundary laws, such as the Historical Records
Survey's <i>West Virginia County Formations and Boundary Changes</i>
(Charleston, W.Va., 1938) are convenient but demand caution. There is a
potential for error in transcription, as well as the possibility that valuable
information (e.g., an effective date) may be lost in the editorial process of
excerpting the selected passages. One useful secondary work was Wendell H.
Rone's <i>Historical Atlas of Kentucky and her Counties, </i>which provides a
good overview of county boundary changes, although the maps are small scale,
highly generalized, and combine many changes on a single map.</p>

      <p>Historical maps do not frequently play a large role in this sort of
work. Occasionally they are indispensable for locating lost landmarks and names
no longer in use, but seldom for interpretations of boundary descriptions. This
is true, for example, of John Filson's famous <i>Map of Kentucke</i> (1784).
The most useful of the historical maps was Luke Munsell's <i>Map of the State
of Kentucky</i> (1818).</span></p>

      <p>Nearly all American states have defined their counties’
areas and limits as lines running from point to point or along specified
courses. These New England states are exceptions to that practice, for they
commonly defined their counties as groups of towns (incorporated
municipalities). In these states a purposeful change for a county was usually
accomplished by changing the mix of towns that composed it. Each of these
states also altered county areas and bounding lines as the consequence of changing
the lines separating towns on opposite sides of a county boundary; when county
boundaries were changed in this fashion that effect appeared inadvertent and
the affected counties often were never named. The method for discovering such
changes requires identifying neighboring cities and towns that could force a
county change and then searching for changes. For Massachusetts that task was
eased considerably by the Secretary of the Commonwealth’s <i>Historical Data
Relating to Counties, Cities, and Towns in Massachusetts</i> (1966), a
remarkably thorough and accurate listing of jurisdictional changes among
municipalities. A similar collection of data for Maine is <i>Counties, Cities,
Towns, and Plantations of Maine: A Handbook of Incorporations, Dissolutions,
and Boundary Changes</i> (1940), originally compiled and published by the
Historical Records Survey for that state.</p>

      <p>In 1763, as part of the peace agreement that ended the Seven
Years War, France and Great Britain established the northern limit of Maine as
the Atlantic–St. Lawrence River watershed, unchanged since then. Subsequent
disputes over Maine’s boundary concerned not its definition but its
implementation. Therefore, in this atlas the modern version of the boundary
line has been depicted from 1763 onward. Two important changes in Maine were
not clear and obvious from the standard sources. The first case concerned
Aroostook County, which extended across the northern cap of Maine in 1844.
Vague wording in the description of Aroostook’s southern limit could be interpreted
to run the county line through a line of western towns, but that would have
been contrary to the common practice of preserving the integrity of
municipalities, so the county boundary has been plotted along the town lines.
The second case involves the boundary that today separates the town of Detroit
in Somerset County from the town of Plymouth in Penobscot County. In 1790, this
county line ran straight north, cutting through several towns, including
Plymouth. Subsequent laws placed the other towns wholly in one county or the
other. However, there is no extant law that adjusted the line through Plymouth.
An act of 29 February 1844 incidentally mentioned that Detroit and Plymouth
were in different counties and implied that such an arrangement was of long
standing. Lacking other evidence, it appears that years before February 1844
officials and residents had adopted the town lines as the de facto county
lines, so in the chronology that change is dated “by” the date on which the
arrangement was so casually revealed. </p>

      <p><b>Dates</b></p>

      <p>Every effort has been made to give the day, month, and year (e.g., 25 February 1785)
for all county creations, boundary changes, and other events in this atlas.
Occasionally it is impossible to date an event so precisely, but a reasonable
estimate is possible. When the precise date is not known or an approximate date
is more appropriate, the date is generalized to the month and year (e.g.,
February 1785) or to the year alone. A lack of evidence may make it impossible
to give any date at all for a county's creation, and its occurrence can only be
confirmed by the record of a later, related happening, such as the appointment
of a sheriff. In such a situation, the date of the later event is used with the
simple addition of "by" (e.g., by 25 February 1785) to indicate that
the county creation or other event occurred no later than that date and
probably earlier.</p>

      <p>The dating standard in this atlas is the legally effective date of change, whether it be
for the creation of a new county or for the alteration of lines between
existing counties. Through the colonial period and into the nineteenth century,
the date a law passed was generally the date it went into effect. As the
nineteenth century progressed, legislators recognized the importance of
preparing for the establishment of a new county organization or for the shift
in jurisdiction that accompanies boundary changes. Some laws, therefore, began
to carry two dates: one marking the passage of the law and the other specifying
when the line change or new county creation would go into effect. If the date
of passage and effective date are different, the law gives both. Connecticut,
however, is an exception. For every county boundary change in Connecticut
before 1820, the date given here usually marks the beginning of the legislative
session. The sessions were short, dates of passage were not given in the
published records, and the opening date of the session is always available. </p>

      <p>Using effective dates means that many of the dates in this atlas may disagree with
dates in other references. As an aid to appreciating how great the differences
between the two dates can be and to help correlate this data with other
publications, this work gives both the date of passage and the effective date
for all county creations. While the maps are keyed to the effective date, a
notation is made in the chronologies giving the date of passage. For example, a
new county created by a law passed 15 January 1832, which did not take effect
until 1 July 1832, would not be mapped until 1 July. But the chronology would
include the entry: “Act passed 15 January 1832; took effect 1 July 1832.” </p>

      <p>Dating events before 1752 is a problem because the calendar then in use is very
different from the one in use today. Whereas by 1600 most of Europe had adopted
the Gregorian calendar, as the modern system of reckoning the days is called,
England observed the Julian calendar until 2 September 1752. For the purposes
of this atlas, the chief differences between the two systems are, first, numbering
the days and, second, designating the change from one year to the next. There
has been no attempt to convert the dates of one system to those of the other.
Differences in numbering days, therefore, are effectively ignored; whatever day
and month are given in a source are the day and month used here, regardless of
whether the document was written in England or some other country, before or
after 1752. Under the old, Julian calendar the last day of the year was 24
March and the first day was 25 March, which means that in England and its
colonies the day after 24 March 1750 was 25 March 1751. This atlas follows the
convention of showing both years for dates that fall within the period from 1
January through 24 March when the different calendars call for different years.
Thus, successive dates before England's adoption of the Gregorian calendar
would occur as follows: the day after 24 March 1688/1689 would be 25 March
1689; the day after 31 December 1689 would be 1 January 1689/1690. About three
months later would come 24 March 1689/1690, and the next day after that would
be 25 March 1690.</p>

       <p><b>Dates</b></p>

      <p>Every effort has been made to give the day, month, and year (e.g., 25 February 1785)
for all county creations, boundary changes, and other events in this atlas.
Occasionally it is impossible to date an event so precisely, but a reasonable
estimate is possible. When the precise date is not known or an approximate date
is more appropriate, the date is generalized to the month and year (e.g.,
February 1785) or to the year alone. A lack of evidence may make it impossible
to give any date at all for a county's creation, and its occurrence can only be
confirmed by the record of a later, related happening, such as the appointment
of a sheriff. In such a situation, the date of the later event is used with the
simple addition of &quot;by&quot; (e.g., by 25 February 1785) to indicate that
the county creation or other event occurred no later than that date and
probably earlier.</p>

      <p>The dating
standard in this atlas is the legally effective date of change, whether it be
for the creation of a new county or for the alteration of lines between
existing counties. Through the colonial period and into the nineteenth century,
the date a law passed was generally the date it went into effect. As the
nineteenth century progressed, legislators recognized the importance of
preparing for the establishment of a new county organization or for the shift
in jurisdiction that accompanies boundary changes. Some laws, therefore, began
to carry two dates: one marking the passage of the law and the other specifying
when the line change or new county creation would go into effect. If the date
of passage and effective date are different, the law gives both. Connecticut,
however, is an exception. For every county boundary change in Connecticut
before 1820, the date given here usually marks the beginning of the legislative
session. The sessions were short, dates of passage were not given in the
published records, and the opening date of the session is always available. </p>

      <p>Using
effective dates means that many of the dates in this atlas may disagree with
dates in other references. As an aid to appreciating how great the differences
between the two dates can be and to help correlate this data with other
publications, this work gives both the date of passage and the effective date
for all county creations. While the maps are keyed to the effective date, a
notation is made in the chronologies giving the date of passage. For example, a
new county created by a law passed 15 January 1832, which did not take effect
until 1 July 1832, would not be mapped until 1 July. But the chronology would
include the entry: “Act passed 15 January 1832; took effect 1 July 1832.” </p>

      <p>Dating
events before 1752 is a problem because the calendar then in use is very
different from the one in use today. Whereas by 1600 most of Europe had adopted
the Gregorian calendar, as the modern system of reckoning the days is called,
England observed the Julian calendar until 2 September 1752. For the purposes
of this atlas, the chief differences between the two systems are, first, numbering
the days and, second, designating the change from one year to the next. There
has been no attempt to convert the dates of one system to those of the other.
Differences in numbering days, therefore, are effectively ignored; whatever day
and month are given in a source are the day and month used here, regardless of
whether the document was written in England or some other country, before or
after 1752. Under the old, Julian calendar the last day of the year was 24
March and the first day was 25 March, which means that in England and its
colonies the day after 24 March 1750 was 25 March 1751. This atlas follows the
convention of showing both years for dates that fall within the period from 1
January through 24 March when the different calendars call for different years.
Thus, successive dates before England's adoption of the Gregorian calendar
would occur as follows: the day after 24 March 1688/1689 would be 25 March
1689; the day after 31 December 1689 would be 1 January 1689/1690. About three
months later would come 24 March 1689/1690, and the next day after that would
be 25 March 1690.</p>

      <hr/>
     
      <p>Prior to the creation of the state of Michigan on 26 January
1837, several states claimed authority over the land within the present state.
Following independence from Great Britain, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New
York raised claims they based on colonial grants and charters; they ceded these
claims to the national government in the 1780s. Virginia attempted to establish
a presence in the area, based on its 1609 colonial charter, and created its
Illinois County in 1778 to encompass the entire area north of the Ohio River
and east of the Mississippi River. Virginia dropped its claim and eliminated
Illinois County in 1784.</p>
   
      <p>Michigan was included in the Northwest Territory when it was
created in 1787. Beginning in 1800, the western part of present Michigan came
under the control of Indiana Territory, while the eastern part remained under
the Northwest Territory until 1803 when Ohio achieved statehood. Between 1803
and 1805, Indiana Territory controlled all of present Michigan. In 1805
Michigan Territory was created to include all of the Lower Peninsula, but most
of the Upper Peninsula remained part of Indiana Territory until 1809 when
jurisdiction of the westernmost portion was transferred to the newly created
Illinois Territory. A wedge in the Upper Peninsula between Illinois Territory
on the west and Michigan Territory on the east remained a remnant of Indiana
Territory until 1816 when Indiana achieved statehood; the area in the Upper
Peninsula then became unorganized federal territory. Finally in 1818, with the
creation of the state of Illinois, Michigan Territory expanded to include all
of present Michigan, all of present Wisconsin, and part of present Minnesota.
However, Michigan Territory's expansion was not complete. In 1834 a large area
west of the Mississippi River was added to the territory, extending Michigan's
jurisdiction into present Iowa, Minnesota, and the Dakotas. Thus, Wisconsin's
first four counties and Iowa's first two counties were all created by Michigan
Territory and remained under its control until 3 July 1836, when Wisconsin
Territory was created, and Michigan Territory was reduced to the area of the
present state. </p>

      <p>Michigan's interstate boundary disputes with Ohio and
Wisconsin affected several counties. Many historians and geographers have
studied the disagreement over the location of the Michigan-Ohio line, which
eventually led to the so-called Toledo War, and several of these sources are
cited in the bibliography. For its southern boundary, Michigan wanted the line
described in the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 and in the act creating Michigan
Territory—a line running due east-west from the southernmost tip of Lake
Michigan. That description did not agree with the description of Ohio's
northern boundary found in its original state constitution. Nearly all
contemporary maps incorrectly placed the southern tip of Lake Michigan north of
its actual location, and Ohioans, worried that available maps were incorrect, feared
losing to Michigan the Lake Erie harbor that became the city of Toledo. Various
surveys were undertaken, neither side was willing to compromise, and between
1815 and 1829 Michigan Territory created four counties (Wayne, Monroe, Lenawee,
and Hillsdale) in the disputed area. </p>

      <p>While Michigan Territory exercised jurisdiction in the area
around Toledo, Ohio, as a full-fledged state, marshaled more political
influence in Congress and kept Michigan from attaining statehood while the
boundary controversy remained unresolved in the early 1830s. Finally, the
combination of congressional pressure and the desire of many Michigan residents
to attain statehood resulted in an extra-legal convention of Michigan citizens
who accepted the Ohio line. Congress immediately admitted Michigan to the Union
(26 January 1837), ending the dispute with Ohio. In contrast to the situation
with Ohio, Michigan’s boundary with Indiana was settled in 1816 when Indiana
achieved statehood, and, although it ran north of the line desired by Michigan,
its establishment elicited little reaction from Detroit.</p>

      <p>The boundary line chosen to separate Michigan from Wisconsin
was supposed to be safe from the kind of problems that plagued the border with
Ohio. With only minor disagreements this was the case until the twentieth
century when the new 1909 Michigan constitution defined the boundary with
Wisconsin in terms that differed from the previous 1850 constitution. The new
definition would have given Michigan jurisdiction over a wedge of territory controlled
by Wisconsin since 1837 and implicitly expanded the jurisdiction of Michigan's
Gogebic County. Nothing happened for several years and Wisconsin continued to
control the area. In 1923 Michigan acted to solidify its claim by filing suit
in the U.S. Supreme Court and expanding the scope of its claim to cover more
territory on the Upper Peninsula and more of the waters and islands of Green
Bay. The Supreme Court in 1926 ruled entirely in Wisconsin's favor, but it
created a new problem by erroneously defining the boundary through Lake
Michigan and Green Bay differently from the intended course. The new line ran
far to the north and gave Wisconsin nearly all of Green Bay and its islands,
most of the Rock Island Passage, plus the tip of the Garden Peninsula of
Michigan. Finally in 1936 this mistake was corrected and the present boundary
was re-established.</p>

      <p>Following the creation of Michigan Territory in 1805,
Territorial Governor William Hull quickly authorized the creation of an unnamed
county centered on Detroit; it would be ten years before Michigan Territory
created another county. No records of this unnamed county have been found, and
it appears no efforts were made to effect its organization. At the same time,
Gov. Hull introduced a new level of civil jurisdiction when he divided the
entire territory into four Districts:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> 
</span>Detroit, Erie, Huron, and Michilimackinac. These county precursors
carried out many of the administrative and judicial functions of the territorial
government. The district system lasted until October 1818, when the judicial
districts were eliminated and their functions taken over by counties. </p>

      <p>The Federal Public Land Survey began in Michigan in 1815,
and by 1840 surveyors had completed work in the Lower Peninsula. With only a
few early exceptions, lawmakers defined county boundaries in terms of the
survey's townships and ranges, making the mapping of Michigan counties very
straightforward and resulting in few problems of interpretation. </p>

      <p>While the counties themselves were relatively stable,
Michigan’s practice of creating unorganized counties presents many challenges.
Unlike many states that created large counties in lightly settled areas and
then divided them into smaller units as the population grew, Michigan created
blocks of counties (e.g., twelve at a time in both 1829 and 1831, and
twenty-nine in an omnibus 1840 law) to cover the entire Lower Peninsula ahead
of settlement. Many of these counties had few or no permanent inhabitants and
could not function independently. Until the population grew to the point where
the unorganized county could begin to carry out its official functions, it was
attached to a fully organized county. Inhabitants in the unorganized county had
to travel to the host county to probate wills, enter land transactions, and
conduct any other legal business. For some counties unorganized status lasted
only a few months, for others it lasted thirty or forty years. The attachments
often changed, so it is possible for records on an individual living in an
unorganized county to be found in the archives of several different host
counties, even though that person never moved. A further complication is the
variety of relationships existing between organized and unorganized counties
that might be specified in the laws. Counties could be attached &quot;for
judicial purposes,&quot; &quot;for township purposes,&quot; &quot;for purposes
of taxation,&quot; etc. The attachment information, taken from the laws and
quoted in the individual county chronologies and consolidated chronology of
this digital atlas, speaks to the complexity of this problem.</p>

      <p>The unorganized counties also affected the way in which
census data was collected and reported. Unlike many states that gave some
status to unorganized counties and counted them separately in the state and
federal censuses, most Michigan state and federal census enumerations do not
break out information from unorganized counties. As late as the 1870s, some
unorganized counties were reported to have no population, while inhabitants of
other unorganized counties were enumerated with their host county. </p>

      <p>Some unorganized counties remained completely unorganized
until their official organization, while in other cases, all or part of the
unorganized county became part of a civil township under the jurisdiction of
the host county. This township system, borrowed from New England and not to be
confused with the survey townships of the Federal Public Land Survey, was very
important in Michigan, and an understanding of this system is often necessary
to understanding the changing jurisdictions. Civil townships were also subject
to change, and one must sometimes piece together the civil township system in
order to effectively search the census for individuals in unorganized counties.
An essential guide for this undertaking is Evolution of Michigan Townships by
the Mid-Michigan Genealogical Society (1972). </p>

      <p>Michigan has experienced an exceptionally large number of
county name changes. In 1840, for example, when twenty-nine new counties were
created, all but one were given Indian names of local or regional significance.
Evidently, these names did not meet with popular approval, no doubt in part
because of the unusual spelling and difficult pronunciation; in 1843 sixteen of
them were renamed. According to William Jenks, many of the new names, such as
Alpena, Alcona, and Tuscola, were invented according to a plan based on Indian
root words that was promulgated by Henry Schoolcraft, a prominent figure in
early Michigan known for his extensive dealings with the Indians of the Great
Lakes. In Jenks's view this was an unfortunate example of replacing meaningful
names with ones of dubious derivation, often lacking in local significance.
Readers who wish more information should consult William L. Jenks's,
&quot;History and Meaning of the County Names of Michigan&quot; (1912) cited in
the bibliography.</p>

      <p>An early boundary in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan,
involving Michilimackinac (now Mackinac) and other counties in what became
Wisconsin, was very imprecisely defined, and geographical knowledge of the area
was spotty. A great help in plotting this boundary was John Farmer's 1831 Map
of the Territories of Michigan and Ouisconsin, which was well known by
contemporaries and depicted the county boundaries as they were recognized at
that time. Historical maps do not frequently play a large role in this sort of
work, as they are seldom useful for interpreting boundary descriptions, but
this map is an exception.</p>

      <hr/>
     
      <p>Minnesota land was
once part of the national public domain and, as such, was divided for sale
according to the federal rectangular survey system. Although some of the
earliest county creations and boundary changes in present Minnesota were based
principally on river systems and extended arbitrary lines, lawmakers quickly
recognized the utility of basing boundaries on the survey system. Thus
territorial officials began incorporating range and township lines into county
boundary descriptions early in their governance of present Minnesota, and that
practice has been continued by subsequent governing bodies. The lines laid down
by those early land surveyors are still in use and remain a prominent and
important feature of the modern maps used to make this atlas. Given the
persistence of the survey lines and their appearance on modern federal maps,
plotting county lines based on the land survey is easier and more precise than
working with metes and bounds descriptions that depend on ridge lines, river
systems, and local landmarks.</p>

      <p>A few boundary
lines cannot be precisely drawn. Some involve natural features or local
landmarks difficult to locate, while a few reflect the vagueness and
imprecision of the laws on which they are based. These uncertain boundaries are
labeled "estimated line" and "indefinite limit,"
respectively. Occasionally a boundary line cannot be drawn as described, due to
some oversight or error in the legislation or typographical error in the printed
statute. The legislature's intent is usually apparent, however, in other
provisions of the law in question or in later boundary changes, and in these
cases the intent—rather than a rigid interpretation—of the law has been
followed.</p>

      <p>The Minnesota state
constitution of 1857 (still in effect, as amended) stipulates that no new
county can be created containing less than 400 square miles and that no
existing county can be reduced below that size by boundary changes. The
constitution also requires that all boundary changes involving organized
counties be approved by the voters of each affected county. An 1893 law
required that new counties have at least 2,000 inhabitants (and no existing
county could be reduced below that), and in 1913 the legislature required that
counties (new and existing) have an assessed property valuation of at least
$4,000,000. In 1917 the valuation requirement was dropped to $3,000,000 for
counties having between 3,500-6,000 square miles, and that was further reduced
to $2,500,000 in 1919.</p>

      <p>In 1893 the legislature
also provided for local initiative in creating new counties, with no
involvement by the legislature. If petitions signed by at least 15% of the
legal voters of each of the counties affected by the creation of the proposed
county were submitted to the secretary of state, the governor—after validation
of the petitions—was to call for a referendum on the question at the next
general election. If the voters approved, the governor proclaimed the new
county "one of the duly organized counties" of Minnesota. In 1895 the
law was amended to require that the petitions be signed by at least 25% of the
legal voters, and it stipulated that the voters could vote on only one such
proposition at each election. Although the 1893 and 1895 laws dealt
specifically with the creation of new counties, the Revised Laws of 1905
extended the provisions to changing the boundaries of existing counties as
well. A 1913 amendment to the Revised Laws also required that referenda on
creating new counties must pass by a majority vote in the area which is to form
the new county—as well as in each of the counties affected.</p>

      <p>The 1893 law
providing for local initiative in creating counties resulted in a flurry of
proposed new counties—many of which failed in referenda and some of which ended
up in the courts for adjudication. Hubbard County (1883) was the last county
created by the legislature; between 1894 and 1922, eight counties were created
by local initiative: Clearwater, Columbia (later nullified by the state supreme
court), Koochiching, Lake of the Woods, Mahnomen, Pennington, Red Lake, and
Roseau.</p>

      <p>Most of the
attempts were to create new counties out of Polk County. In November 1894 all
four counties proposed were defeated in referenda: Columbia, Nash, Nelson, and
Red Lake. At the next general election, in November 1896, Polk voters voted on
six proposals for new counties—some of which had overlapping boundaries.
Garfield, Hill, and Nelson were defeated, while Columbia, Mills, and Red Lake
each passed on a majority vote. The governor proclaimed Red Lake the sole
winner, and the state supreme court upheld that determination. The creation of
Columbia County from Polk in November 1902 also ended up in the state supreme
court for final resolution. In that election, the proposed counties of Nelson
and Star were also approved by Polk voters (Valley was defeated), but the
governor proclaimed only Columbia as being created. The court overturned that
decision in April 1903, and Columbia thus became extinct. The final attempt to
create a new county from Polk was made in November 1908, when the proposed
county of Nelson was defeated in a referendum.</p>

      <p>In ruling on the
referenda of 1896 and 1902, the state supreme court noted in its 1903 opinion
that the 1893 law (and amendment of 1895) was "a very difficult statute to
construe. It is badly constructed, and far from complete in many respects. It
has been before this court more than once...." Red Lake's creation in 1896
was upheld by the court, even though the voters also approved the creation of
Columbia and Mills at the same election. In rejecting Columbia and Mills, the
court ruled that any Polk County elector could legally sign any non-competing
petitions for creation of new counties, that all proposed creations supported
by valid petitions must be submitted to the voters, but that only one of the
competing propositions could be approved at the same election. Finally, the
court asserted that the winning proposal must have a majority of the votes cast
on it, as well as a plurality of the votes cast on the propositions with which
it was competing. Red Lake met the test; Columbia and Mills did not.</p>

      <p>The provisions of
the 1893 and 1895 laws were again at issue in 1903 when the state supreme court
set aside the creation of Columbia (declared the winner of the 1902 election by
the governor). This time, all four proposed counties (Columbia, Nelson, Star,
and Valley) covered the same territory of Polk County, and the contest was
principally over location of the county seat of the new county. Columbia polled
more votes than Nelson and Star at the election on 4 November 1902 (the
proposal to create Valley County was defeated), and the governor duly
proclaimed the new county of Columbia. In striking down the governor's
decision, the court ruled that only one proposition involving the same
territory can be voted on at each election, and that the first valid petition
presented for creation of a new county has precedence when more than one are
filed. In this case, the petition to create Nelson County was filed with the
secretary of state on 13 December 1900, whereas the petition for Columbia was
filed the next day. The court consequently ruled the election and creation of
Columbia invalid. Parenthetically, the court noted that there must be
"material and substantial" differences in the territory to be
included in each proposed county when more than one appeared on the ballot at
the same election.</p>

      <p>There were also
efforts in 1894 to create one or two new counties in the
Nicollet/Renville/Sibley area, although neither proposal was submitted to the
voters (and one apparently never went beyond the petition stage). The proposed
county of Birch Coulee (or Birch Cooley) was to include eleven or twelve
adjoining full and partial townships of western Nicollet, southeastern Renville,
and western Sibley, and although the governor called for a referendum on the
proposal, the election was never held. A separate petition drive aimed to
combine seven townships in eastern and northeastern Renville County with
adjoining Sibley townships to form a new county. Both of these efforts were
closely related to the spirited contest in early 1894 for location of the
Renville county seat (Olivia was chosen in a special election in June 1894).</p>

      <p>Many Minnesota
counties were created before there was adequate population to support them, and
the legislature consequently devised a system of attachments, whereby newly
created counties were often attached to existing counties for various purposes.
In some cases, the statute creating a county provided for the full organization
of the county, including provisions for electing the county commissioners and
county officers. At the same time, the new county was often attached to an
existing county, usually "for judicial purposes," "for judicial
and record purposes," or "for judicial and other purposes." The
precise nature of some of these attachments is not always clear, and thus the
precise wording of the phrase is included in both the main chronology and
individual county chronology in quotation marks.</p>

      <p>Many counties were
not "organized," i.e., authorized to conduct county business, at
creation. In those cases a separate statute was generally enacted to effect the
county organization, designated as organized for county purposes in this atlas.
There was often a considerable delay between creation of a county and its
organization for county purposes; Beltrami County, for example, was created in
1866 but not fully organized for county purposes until 1897. For much of the
intervening period it was attached to Becker County "for record and
judicial purposes." Seventy-seven of Minnesota's 87 counties were
organized for county purposes by statute, either at creation or later; for the
9 counties (Chippewa, Dodge, Goodhue, Lyon, Mille Lacs, Olmstead, Otter Tail,
Swift, and Watonwan) for which no "organizing" statute has been
found, the county is considered organized for county purposes in this atlas on
the date of the first meeting of the county commissioners. Hennepin was fully
organized when the U.S. Senate ratified the Treaty of Mendota with the Sioux.</p>

      <p>Some of the ambiguity in the
status of counties was reflected in the state supreme court’s ruling in 1878
concerning the status of big Stone County as an organized county. Big Stone was
created in 1862, and in 1873 and 1874 the board of county commissioners
(appointed by the governor) proceeded to fill the other county offices which
organized counties typically had. The county officers were chosen again in the
general elections of 1874 and 1876, and they fully performed the duties of
their respective offices. bills to “organize” Big Stone were introduced into
the legislature in 1873, 1874,and 1875, but all failed, and thus the county’s
status as an organized county was challenged in court. the district court ruled
that Big Stone was “for all the purposes” of the relevant statutes an organized
county, but the supreme court overturned that decision.</p>

      <p>In
rejecting Big Stone’s status as an organized county, the supreme court noted
that the state constitution (Article XI) “recognizes” a distinction between
organized and established counties. The court defined the “establishing” of a
county as “the setting apart of certain territory to be in the future organized
as a political community, or quasi-corporation for political purposes; and the
organizing of a county is the vesting in the people of such territory such
corporate rights and powers.” Futher, the court ruled that the state
constitution vested the power of establishing and organizing counties “wholly”
with the legislature, “and, until some act of the legislature authorizing it,
the people of no district have the right to act as an organized county.</p>

      <p>n this
atlas, twenty-two counties are identified as “fully organized” (for county
government and judicial and other purposes) at creation. For the other
counties, in the absence of a specific reference to organization or attachment,
the reader should assume that each county was unorganized for county government
purposes and unattached for judicial and other purposes until stated otherwise.
Mille Lacs County, for example, was created (or established) on 23 May 1857 –
unorganized and unattached. On 18 March 1858 it was attached to Morrison County
“for judicial purposes,” and on 25 February 1860 it was “organized” for county
government. However, Mille Lacs was not “fully organized” until it was detached
from Morrison on 31 July 1866.</p>

      <p>Approximately 100
proposed county creations and boundary changes have been submitted to the
voters for approval. Virtually all of these referenda were held at the regular
general elections in November. Where there is specific evidence that the
referendum passed (or there is a reasonable inference thereof), the date of the
referendum is used as the effective date in the text. In cases where it is
known that the referendum failed, the referendum is marked as having
"failed" and the date of the law authorizing the referendum is used
for the entry. Finally, the phrase "change not effected" is used for
some proposed boundary changes when it is clear that the boundary did not
change, but for which no information about the required referendum has been
located.</p>

      <p>Although
territorial and state officials generally respected Indian rights to the land
and often incorporated Indian boundary lines in county boundaries, they
routinely extended county lines in present Minnesota to the limits of their
jurisdiction. They thus anticipated and encouraged the migration of non-Indian
settlers into the region well before the Indian tribes ceded their territory to
the government. In this atlas the county boundaries are drawn as described in
the laws, with due regard to the Indian boundary lines when they were part of
the boundary—but with no recognition of the gradual purchase of Indian lands by
territorial, state, and federal governments.</p>

      <p><b>Pre-Territorial Period</b></p>

      <p>Most of
modern Montana was acquired by the United States from France through the
Louisiana Purchase of 1803, while that part of Montana west of the Continental
Divide remained under British control. The larger, eastern section was
successively part of the District of Louisiana, Louisiana Territory, Missouri
Territory, unorganized federal territory, Nebraska Territory, and Dakota
Territory. Jurisdiction over the area of modern Montana remained split along
the Continental Divide until 3 March 1863 when Idaho Territory expanded to encompass
the entire modern state. In 1804, the District of Louisiana created two huge
counties, which included territory in present Montana. In 1812 and 1813 those
counties were reduced in size, and no counties existed in the eastern
two-thirds of Montana until 1864. Oregon and Washington Territories did include
the area west of the Rocky Mountains within several large counties, which often
stretched hundreds of miles across two or three modern states.</p>

      <p>Most of
these early counties had no practical impact on Montana, since there were few
white residents in the area. Beginning in the late 1850s, several events opened
the Montana country to settlers, and made it essential to establish
governmental control of western Montana. In 1855, Washington Territorial Governor
Isaac Stevens negotiated treaties with several Indian tribes. One of the treaty
provisions permitted whites limited usage of Blackfoot lands, including the
establishment of military forts, and the building of roads and telegraph lines.
The Mullan Road, completed in 1862, was constructed from the Columbia River in
Washington Territory, along the Clark’s Fork and across the Continental Divide
to Fort Benton in Montana. While it was barely more than a footpath in some
sections, the road did link East and West through western Montana. Finally, the
discovery of gold in the late 1850s brought an influx of people to the area. As
more non-Indians poured into western Montana, Washington Territory authorized
the creation of Missoula County on 14 December 1860 to establish some
territorial authority and provide governmental services. This new county
covered most of the area of present Montana west of the Continental Divide.
Missoula County can lay claim to having the longest continuous history of any
Montana county, carrying over from Washington Territory, to Idaho Territory, to
Montana Territory, and finally becoming part of the state of Montana. </p>

      <p><b>Territorial Period</b></p>
 
      <p>The
boundaries of the state of Montana are unchanged since its establishment as a
territory on 26 May 1864—with one small exception. A triangular area of about
one and one-half square miles located west of Wyoming, north of the Continental
Divide, and south of 44 degrees, 30 minutes north latitude, had originally
belonged to Dakota Territory. When Wyoming Territory was established in 1868,
this area was assigned to neither Wyoming nor Montana, and thus remained
technically a part of Dakota Territory, though separated from the rest of the
Dakotas by hundreds of miles. This oversight was corrected by the United States
Congress on 17 February 1873, when it transferred the small area to Montana
Territory. However, the confusion continued when the Montana Territorial
Legislature mistakenly assigned the addition to Beaverhead and Madison
Counties, which are located many miles from the orphaned area. The small
triangle was actually located adjacent to Gallatin County, and it is a part of
that county today. Poor geographical knowledge of this area, plus an apparent
dependence on W. W. de Lacy’s 1865 map of Montana (which had been prepared at
the request of the territorial legislature, and which erroneously depicted the
Madison and Gallatin Rivers east of their actual locations in relation to the
northwest corner of Wyoming), resulted in this mistake, which was never
officially corrected by the legislature.</p>

      <p>Disputes in
the Montana Territorial Legislature, which had nothing directly to do with
county boundaries, also affected county creation. Divided Civil War loyalties,
combined with concerns over federal Indian and territorial policies, fueled
clashes between the largely Democratic territorial legislature and the largely
Republican territorial officials. Things came to a head in 1866 over whether
the seating of the 2d and 3d sessions of the Democratic-Party-dominated
territorial legislature violated the provisions of the territorial Organic Act.
On 2 March 1867, the United States Congress, and its Republican majority,
declared all acts of the 2d and 3d Montana Territorial Legislature null and
void (<i>U.S. Statutes at Large</i>, vol. 14, ch. 150[1867], sec. 6/p.
427). Meagher and Musselshell Counties,
both created in 1866, became casualties of this dispute. Meagher County was
quickly re-established by the 4th session of the territorial
legislature in November 1867, but a new Musselshell County did not reappear
until 1911.</p>

       <p><b>Indian Reservations</b></p>

      <p>In general,
county boundaries across the United States have been created with almost total
disregard for Indian reservations. The practice followed by compilers of the
Atlas of Historical County Boundaries has been to adhere to the instructions
for county lines as set forth in session laws—regardless of how they relate to
the reservations. Sometimes treaty lines were used to define county boundaries,
but rarely were reservations left outside county jurisdiction for any extended
period of time. In Montana, the Crow Indian Reservation in the southeastern
part of the state is the only one that figured into county boundaries. In 1881,
the Crow agreed to cede part of their reserve to the federal government, and
the treaty was ratified by the U. S. Congress on 11 April 1882. Anticipating
this cession, the Montana Territorial Legislature passed an act on 14 February
1881 to add all of the cession to Gallatin County, declaring that the area
“shall, upon the ratification of said treaty, be attached to and become a part
of Gallatin county, Montana” (Mont. Terr. Laws 1881, 12<sup>th</sup> leg., p.
124). This is the first explicit mention of the Crow Reservation as it related
to county boundaries. Based on boundary descriptions dating from 1872, the
remaining Crow Reservation was within the boundaries of Custer County. On 5
March 1885, the territorial legislature further complicated matters by
attaching some of the Crow Reservation (the part west of the Big Horn River) to
Yellowstone County for judicial purposes. This, in effect, made part of the
reservation a non-county area attached to Yellowstone County, while the area
east of the Big Horn River remained part of Custer County. A further land
cession by the Crow in 1891 was added to Yellowstone County. The remaining
portion of the Crow reserve west of the Big Horn River became part of
Yellowstone County on 5 March 1897. Today the Crow Reservation lies across both
Yellowstone and Big Horn Counties.</p>

      <p><b>County-Splitting in the Twentieth Century</b></p>

      <p>In the
early years of Montana Territory, county development proceeded at a deliberate
pace, so that by the end of 1911, there were only twenty-nine counties. Between
1912 and 1925, activity increased and the number of counties nearly doubled to
fifty-six; in contrast, the population of Montana increased only 15% between
1910 and 1930. Why the sudden rush to new counties? A combination of factors
made Montana’s prospects look bright—most of the state had been surveyed and
homesteaders were moving in, World War I brought a heightened demand for
several natural resources found in Montana, the railroads were expanding and
promoting settlement, and the weather produced good crop-growing conditions
(Chaney, “Dan McKay”). Since territorial days, county creation was the
responsibility of the legislature, but in 1911, the legislature passed an act
shifting responsibility for county creation to local citizens and boards of
county commissioners. Citizens could then petition their county board, and if
certain conditions were met, the commissioners would call an election to vote
on the establishment of a new county.</p>

      <p>In 1912,
Blaine and Hill Counties were created using this new method of “petition and
election,” and in subsequent years even more new counties were created. Much of
this activity was promoted and encouraged by Dan McKay, who became known as
Montana’s leading “county splitter.”  McKay is known to have been involved in the 
creation of at least seven,
and perhaps as many as twelve, Montana counties. He was a lobbyist and civic
booster extraordinaire who saw a business opportunity in, first, convincing
folks that they needed a new county, and, second, helping them with the legal
and political maneuvers that led to success. Playing upon local boosterism,
optimism about Montana’s future growth, and highlighting the advantages of a
new county (less distance to travel to the county seat, more county jobs, improved
economic prospects for the new county seat, etc.), McKay then offered himself
as the person who could make this happen—and all for a fee of only $1500
(Burlingame, “Political Divisions,” 17–18). It is not surprising that such
efforts sometimes resulted in heated exchanges wrapped up in civic pride, envy,
regionalism, and greed. A headline from <i>The Fairview Times </i>(Richland
County) of 28 January 1915 provides some idea of the importance these actions
could signify, “<i>Look At This! How
Thimblerigging Politicians Bunco and Flim-Flam the People In Making New
Counties</i>.” This article is about the problem boundary between Wibaux and
Richland Counties. Richland County was created by petition and election on 27
May 1914, while Wibaux was created by the same means on 17 August 1914. The two
counties shared a common boundary, but the legal boundary descriptions did not
match, creating a disputed area that both counties claimed, and in which both
counties created precincts and selected judges. The situation was rectified in
February 1915 when the state legislature passed a law giving Richland County
control of most of the disputed area, but months of acrimony surrounded the
settling of the boundary dispute.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately,
the rosy outlook for Montana in 1911 had changed by the early 1920s. The end of
World War I meant decreased demand for certain resources, and drought spread
across much of the state. The cost of operating the new counties outstripped
the ability of county residents to pay the necessary taxes. Delinquent taxes
and foreclosures increased, and many of these new counties came close to
bankruptcy.</p>

      <p><b>Yellowstone National Park</b></p>

      <p>Yellowstone
National Park, created as America’s first national park in 1872, also affected
Montana’s county boundaries. While most of the park lies in Wyoming, the
northern edge and part of the western side are in Montana, covering just 263 of
the Park’s 3468 square miles. Between 1887 and 1978, that part of Yellowstone
National Park in Montana was outside the jurisdiction of any county. (A similar
situation did not exist with Glacier National Park, also located in Montana.)
When Park County was created from Gallatin County on 1 May 1887, the
legislation very clearly and intentionally excluded Yellowstone National Park
from Park County’s boundaries. This situation was known as “Exclusive
Legislative Jurisdiction” in which the federal government retains most county
responsibilities (Van Zandt, 150). As early as 1929, this peculiar status
raised questions about taxation and the validity of marriages (Haines,
2:332–333), but throughout the early twentieth century the revised codes of
Montana confirmed Yellowstone’s exclusion from the state’s network of counties.
It was not until April 1977 that the Montana legislature passed a law adding parts
of Yellowstone National Park to Gallatin and Park Counties, subject to the
approval of voters in the two counties. The proposal was approved at the
election held 7 November 1978, ending the non-county status of the national
park.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></p>

      <p>Two works by Merrill G. Burlingame were useful in the
compilation of Montana. His <i>History of Montana</i> (1957), written with K.
Ross Toole, provided background information and explained events in Montana
history. Burlingame’s unpublished “Political Divisions in Montana” (1974)
documented the evolution of counties and the development of Indian
reservations. The <i>Montana Atlas and Gazetteer</i> (1994), a modern
collection of topographic maps, was helpful in accurately locating geographic
features and lines of longitude and latitude. Nineteenth-century maps of
Montana, available online at “David Rumsey Map Collection”
(http://www.davidrumsey.com) were used to identify locales that have changed
name or disappeared.</p>

      <p>Special thanks are due Elaine Hooley of the MonDak Heritage
Center for help with the Richland County/Wibaux County boundary. Queries to
several counties were met with generous responses. Staff from the offices of
Clerk and Recorder in Dawson, Fallon, Hill, Richland, Sheridan, and Wibaux
Counties, as well as several local librarians, provided copies of county
commissioners’ minutes, maps, newspaper clippings, and other helpful
information.</p>

      <hr/>
     
      <p><b>Special Topics</b></p>

      <p>The many boundary adjustments,
clarifications, and redefinitions reflect the fact that for much of North
Carolina's history, counties (called precincts before 1738) were created
against a backdrop of expanding population and often inadequate geographical knowledge.
For other reasons as well, some imprecision in drawing historical county
boundaries in North Carolina is inevitable. The laws frequently direct that
boundaries run along mountain ridges, between river systems, and to the
"head" of a river or stream—directions all somewhat vague and
imprecise. Also, boundaries often involve landmarks that cannot be identified
today, for example, the property of named individuals, roads, water fords,
ferries, mills, and river landings. Finally, some boundaries were ephemeral,
disappearing completely in later boundary changes, sometimes after only a brief
period. Judging by the many boundary disputes and the stated reasons for
specific boundary changes, it is also apparent that many county boundaries were
not surveyed or clearly marked. For these reasons, some historical county
boundaries are conjectural; in this volume these are depicted with dashes
labeled "estimated line." During the early years of Euro-American
settlement in North Carolina, some boundary limits (especially western) were
left undefined; Anson (1749), Rowan (1753), Mecklenburg (1763), Tryon (1769),
and Guilford (1771), for example, had no western limits specified. These
undefined boundaries are identified in the text as "indefinite
limits" and the lines used in those cases must be viewed as no more than
convenient representations of the county limits at the time.</p>

      <p>Mountain ranges were a barrier to
precise boundary descriptions in the west, and thus many western boundaries
were altered repeatedly as settlers moved west and required more precise
boundaries. The difficulty of mapping boundary changes in the mountainous west
is illustrated by the Ashe/Wilkes boundary and, after 1859 (when Alleghany was
created from Ashe), by the Alleghany/Wilkes boundary. Ashe was created from
Wilkes in 1799, with the boundary line to run along "the extreme
height" of the Appalachian Mountains. Between 1799 and 1901 the line was
changed six times (in 1835, 1877, 1879, 1885, 1887, and 1891); all changes were
minor and involved landmarks which either cannot be located today or were made
to accommodate local property owners. In 1901 the legislature
"restored" the Ashe/Wilkes boundary to "the old boundary
line" along the "top of the Blue Ridge." But following this
return to the original 1799 boundary, the line has again been changed eight
times—in each case for the convenience of a local property owner or owners. Of
the fourteen changes, from 1799 to 1990, three laws repealed earlier boundary
changes; in the most extreme case, a boundary change enacted in 1913 was
repealed in 1957.</p>

      <p>Similarly, the boundary between
Alleghany and Wilkes Counties has been changed nine times since Alleghany was
created in 1859. In most instances the change was made for the convenience of
local property owners, and in each case only a small amount of land was
involved. Some of the uncertainty of boundary lines in mountainous areas is
also reflected in three other statutes involving the Alleghany/Wilkes line: in
1909 the legislature defined part of the boundary, citing "some dispute
and misunderstanding as to the correct line"; a 1911 law provided for the
clarification of an 1891 boundary change, declaring that the 1891 line
"has never been run and is in dispute between certain points"; and in
1939 the legislature defined part of the boundary, asserting that "there
is uncertainty as to the exact location of the county line." Other
boundaries in mountainous areas, especially in the northwest (e.g.,
Alleghany/Ashe, Ashe/Watauga, and Watauga/Wilkes), present similar problems in
mapping.</p>

      <p>In creating counties and altering
existing county boundaries, the legislature largely ignored Indian (principally
Cherokee) claims to land in present North Carolina and Tennessee (part of North
Carolina until 1790). The Indian Boundary Line of 1767, running diagonally
across the state from the present-day counties of Polk on the south to
Alleghany on the north, was devised by British colonial officials to protect
Indian lands west of the line from encroachment by Euro-American settlers. A
subsequent series of land cessions by the Indians nullified that boundary,
until by the end of the eighteenth century only the southwestern corner of
present North Carolina and approximately two-thirds of present Tennessee were
still nominally controlled by Indians.</p>

      <p>The North Carolina legislature
first referred to an Indian boundary line in drawing county boundaries in 1771,
when it directed that the Mecklenburg/Tryon boundary with Rowan (which had
"not as yet been ascertained") run due west until it intersected the
"Cherokee Indian Line." In 1777 the legislature ignored all Indian
claims to the land when it included all of present Tennessee in the newly
created Washington County and extended Burke County to the present North
Carolina/Tennessee boundary. South of Burke, Rutherford County was created from
Tryon in 1779, with its northern boundary running through the "old
Cherokee line" to the present North Carolina/Tennessee line. Roughly the
western half of Rutherford and a small part of western Burke were
"reserved" for the Cherokee in 1783, but the reservation did not
affect county boundaries. Only in the creation of Greene (Tenn.) in 1783 did
the legislature appear to have respected the boundaries of the Cherokee
reserve.</p>

      <p>Thus, by the end of the American
Revolution the North Carolina legislature had created counties for all of
present North Carolina and most of Tennessee, even though the Cherokee did not
make their final cessions of land in the two states (in southwestern North
Carolina and southeastern Tennessee) until 1835. In this atlas the county
boundary lines are drawn as described in the laws, with no allowance for Indian
claims to the land.</p>

      <p>A particular problem was posed by
boundary changes made for the convenience of named individuals, often with few
or no geographic clues as to location of the land involved. As noted above,
many of these occur in western, mountainous areas of the state; but they occur
in other parts of the state as well. Most of these changes could not be mapped
in this atlas; in the chronologies they are identified as gains or losses of
small areas to accommodate local property owners.</p>

      <p>There have never been any
constitutional restrictions on the legislature's authority to create new
counties or to alter the boundaries of existing counties. Ten county creations
have been submitted by the legislature to the voters of the affected areas for
approval. Seven were approved: Alamance (1849), Yadkin (1851), Dare (1870),
Pamlico (1872), Durham (1881), Vance (1881), and Lee (1908). Voters rejected
three creations (Hooper, 1851; Lillington, 1859; and Scotland, 1895), although
Scotland was subsequently re-created by the legislature in 1899, with no
referendum. Also, twelve boundary changes were submitted to the affected
residents for approval, beginning in 1851; nine were approved.</p>

      <p><b>Dates</b></p>

      <p>Every effort has been made to give the day, month, and
year (e.g., 25 February 1785) for all county creations, boundary changes, and
other events in this atlas. Occasionally it is impossible to date an event so
precisely, but a reasonable estimate is possible. When the precise date is not
known or an approximate date is more appropriate, the date is generalized to
the month and year (e.g., February 1785) or to the year alone. A lack of
evidence may make it impossible to give any date at all for a county's
creation, and its occurrence can only be confirmed by the record of a later,
related happening, such as the appointment of a sheriff. In such a situation,
the date of the later event is used with the simple addition of "by"
(e.g., by 25 February 1785) to indicate that the county creation or other event
occurred no later than that date and probably earlier.</p>

      <p>Several dates may be associated with the creation of a
county or a change in county lines. To many individuals the date that makes the
most sense is the one when people began to observe the change, but in most
cases that date is impossible to ascertain. An alternative is the date on which
the law effecting the change passed the legislature or was approved by the
governor. The date of passage is an important reference because it helps
identify the law; now, as in the past, references to a law often include the
date of passage. Most other compilations of county changes have adopted the
date of passage as their standard for the date of change, but it is not always
the best indicator of when change occurred.</p>

      <p>The dating standard in this atlas is the legally effective
date of change, whether it be for the creation of a new county or for the
alteration of lines between existing counties. Through the colonial period and
into the nineteenth century, the date a law passed was generally the date it
went into effect. As the nineteenth century progressed, legislators recognized
the importance of preparing for the establishment of a new county organization
or for the shift in jurisdiction that accompanies boundary changes. Some laws,
therefore, began to carry two dates: one marking the passage of the law and the
other specifying when the line change or new county creation would go into
effect. Using effective dates means that many of the dates in this atlas may
disagree with dates in other references. </p>

      <p>Before 1836 very few North Carolina session laws have a
specific date of approval; from 1836 onward, they all do. Until 1761 the only
date usually associated with the laws is the opening date of the session at
which the laws were approved; from 1761 through 1835 virtually all laws were
read three times and approved at the end of each session. In this atlas, those
dates (opening of session or blanket approval at end of session) are used for
all laws passed before 1836, when the laws have no specific date of approval or
effective date. The date of an election or referendum—when known—has been used
for the effective date for all county creations and boundary changes subject to
voter approval; in the few cases where the date of the election is unknown, the
date of the statute authorizing the election has been used. </p>

      <p>Dating events before 1752 is a problem because the
calendar then in use is very different from the one in use today. Whereas by
1600 most of Europe had adopted the Gregorian calendar, as the modern system of
reckoning the days is called, England observed the Julian calendar until 2
September 1752. For the purposes of this atlas, the chief differences between
the two systems are, first, numbering the days and, second, designating the
change from one year to the next. There has been no attempt to convert the
dates of one system to those of the other. Differences in numbering days,
therefore, are effectively ignored; whatever day and month are given in a
source are the day and month used here, regardless of whether the document was written
in England or some other country, before or after 1752. Under the old, Julian
calendar the last day of the year was 24 March and the first day was 25 March,
which means that in England and its colonies the day after 24 March 1750 was 25
March 1751. This atlas follows the convention of showing both years for dates
that fall within the period from 1 January through 24 March when the different
calendars call for different years. Thus, successive dates before England's
adoption of the Gregorian calendar would occur as follows: the day after 24
March 1688/1689 would be 25 March 1689; the day after 31 December 1689 would be
1 January 1689/1690. About three months later would come 24 March 1689/1690,
and the next day after that would be 25 March 1690.</p>

      <p>The land that makes up the modern
state of Ohio was originally claimed by Virginia under its 1609 charter and was
part of Virginia’s Illinois County from 1778 to 1784. Connecticut also used its
colonial charter to claim part of Ohio from the Revolutionary War to 1800: the
Western Reserve in the northeastern part of the state. From 1787 until 1803,
when Ohio attained statehood and its state boundaries were settled, it was part
of the Northwest Territory. In the nineteenth century, Indiana Territory, and
later, Michigan Territory, claimed part of present Ohio along its northern
border</p>

      <p><b>Ohio Land Subdivisions</b></p>

      <p>Ohio was the first state carved out of the Northwest
Territory. The subdivision of Ohio lands differed markedly from the other
states that were later created from the Territory. All those states (Indiana,
Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Minnesota) were surveyed using the
rectangular Public Land Survey System (PLSS) established by the federal Land
Ordinance of 1785; Ohio lacks a comparable uniformity because it was the
subject of nine major, different land surveys. Eight of those nine surveys are
based in principle on a rectangular system, but their diverse numbering systems
and variations in township size make a crazy quilt of most of Ohio. The
northwestern quarter of the state is the only area of Ohio where the PLSS was
implemented. The different systems complicate any attempt to understand county
creation in Ohio, especially in the cases where county boundaries traverse
different survey subdivisions.</p>

      <p>Some subdivisions are the results of claims made by
colonies on land north of the Ohio River. One of these, the Virginia Military
District, covers parts of twenty-three counties in southwestern Ohio. When
Virginia ceded its claim to lands north of the Ohio River, it reserved the
Military District to settle military bounty land warrants it had issued to pay
veterans for service in the Revolutionary War. Surveying by metes and bounds,
common in Virginia, was continued in the District, which is the only part of
Ohio not surveyed on some sort of rectangular system.</p>

      <p>Based on the English Crown’s charter to the colony of
Connecticut in the 1600s, the state of Connecticut claimed land in present Ohio
between 41 degrees and 42 degrees, 2 minutes north latitude. In 1786,
Connecticut ceded its charter claims to lands north of the Ohio River and west
of Pennsylvania to the United States, but retained an area in northeastern
Ohio—Connecticut’s Western Reserve—that extended 120 miles westward from the
Pennsylvania line. Connecticut never created counties or established a
governmental presence in the Western Reserve; in 1800, the state ceded the
Reserve to the United States and it became part of the Northwest Territory.</p>

      <p>The Western Reserve was divided into townships five
miles square, rather than the six-mile-square townships that are standard in
the PLSS. The demarcation of the southern and western boundaries caused some
confusion in the establishment of county boundaries. Connecticut defined the
Western Reserve’s southern line as the parallel of 41 degrees north latitude,
and the western limit as a line running north-south through a point 120 miles
west of Pennsylvania. Both lines, as surveyed, depart somewhat from this
description: the western line is slightly more than 120 miles west of
Pennsylvania, and the southern boundary slightly south of 41 degrees north
latitude. Early laws that defined the lines as running along the southern or
western boundaries of the Western Reserve have been mapped according to the
surveyed lines, rather than the presumed lines of latitude and longitude.</p>

      <p><b>The Ohio-Michigan Boundary</b></p>

      <p>The dispute over the location of the Ohio-Michigan
line, which eventually led to the so-called “Toledo War,” has been described in
detail in the secondary literature, and a number of these works are included in
the bibliography. Michigan struggled to secure the boundary as described in the
Northwest Ordinance of 1787 and in the act creating Michigan Territory in 1805:
a line running due east-west from the southernmost tip of Lake Michigan. This
definition conflicted with the description written into Ohio’s 1802 state
constitution, which provided for running a line to “the most northerly cape of
the Miami Bay” (art. 7, sec. 6). Ohioans, worried that available maps were
incorrect, feared that Michigan would gain Maumee Bay and the fledgling city of
Toledo when surveyors later marked the line. Their concern was well founded,
for nearly all available contemporary maps incorrectly placed the southern tip
of Lake Michigan north of its actual location. Various surveys were taken, but
neither side was willing to compromise. For years Michigan Territory actually
controlled Toledo and the area along the boundary, and it created four counties
that extended into the disputed territory. </p>

      <p>While Michigan Territory exercised jurisdiction in
the disputed area, Ohio, as a full-fledged state, was able to marshal more
political influence in Congress and prevented Michigan from attaining statehood
while the boundary controversy remained unresolved. Finally, the combination of
congressional pressure and the desire of many Michigan residents to attain
statehood resulted in an extra-legal convention of Michigan citizens, held in
Ann Arbor in December 1836, that accepted Ohio’s version of the line. Congress
acted immediately to admit Michigan to the Union, thus ending the dispute in
Ohio’s favor.</p>

      <p><b>County Creation and Change</b></p>

      <p>Nearly all of Ohio’s pre-statehood counties were
created by proclamation of the governor of the Northwest Territory, but
subsequent creations were the result of legislative enactments. Only an 1874
boundary change between Highland and Brown Counties occurred without direct
legislative action.</p>

      <p>The Indian presence in Ohio also affected the
development of counties. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 specifically forbade the creation
of counties in areas where the federal government had not extinguished the
Indian title to the land, but this restriction was not always observed. The
Northwest Territory and the state of Ohio both created counties in northwestern
Ohio without regard to Indian land claims (for example, Franklin, Greene,
Montgomery, and Wayne [Northwest Territory]). On the other hand, the well-known
Greenville Treaty Line (1795) defined the limits of several counties in the
nineteenth century, and remnants of the line continue to serve as county
boundaries today. Except for a few small reserves, all Indian claims in Ohio
were extinguished by the Treaty of St. Mary’s in 1818. </p>

      <p>Beginning in 1808 with the creation of Stark and
Wayne Counties, Ohio began to distinguish between unorganized and fully
organized counties. This system of county creation, which became widespread
throughout the Midwest, produced some counties that did not carry out
governmental functions on their own but were attached to fully organized
counties for official services. Inhabitants of unorganized counties had to
travel to the seat of the host county to probate wills, enter land
transactions, and conduct other county business. This dependent status allowed
the new county time to gain sufficient population, organize elections, and
prepare to take on the judicial and administrative duties of county government.
For some counties unorganized status lasted only a month, while for others it
lasted more than a decade. Paulding County remained unorganized the longest,
attached first to Wood County and then to Williams County for a total of
nineteen years. Since attachments sometimes changed, as in the case of Paulding
County, it is possible for records on an individual living in an initially
unorganized county to be found in several different counties, even though the
person never moved.</p>

      <p>A further complication is the variety of
relationships that could exist between organized and unorganized counties. In
most cases in Ohio, no specific purpose for the attachment is stated in the
state session laws. Sometimes the reason for the attachment is stated in the
law—“for judicial purposes” being the most common. While it is beyond the scope
of this work to define the precise meaning of each phrase at various points in
time, the shifts in terminology may be important for researchers. Therefore,
when the purpose of the attachment is stated in the law, it is quoted in both
the consolidated chronology and the individual county chronologies (e.g., “for
judicial purposes”). When no specific purpose for the attachment is stated, the
phrase <i>for administrative and judicial purposes</i> is given without
quotation marks.</p>

      <p>The1810 and 1820 federal censuses for Ohio did not
enumerate unorganized counties separately. Unorganized counties were apparently
included with their host county. Unorganized counties are thus not generally
mentioned by name, except for two instances in 1820. In subsequent federal
censuses, the distinction between organized and unorganized counties was not
observed, and all counties were enumerated separately, regardless of their
organizational status.</p>

      <p>Lack of geographical knowledge, carelessness, unclear
wording and punctuation, and an inattention to earlier legislation are common
in the boundary legislation of many states, but Ohio’s county boundary
legislation ranks among the most accurate and unambiguously worded in the
nation. The accuracy of Ohio laws is all the more remarkable when one considers
the multiple land subdivisions in the state, which certainly increased the
chance for errors. This means that most historical Ohio county configurations
can be drawn with a high degree of accuracy; few descriptions are open to
multiple interpretations.</p>

      <p>One oversight involves the Seneca Gore, a small
triangular area in the southeast corner of Seneca County. Seneca County was
created 1 April 1820 and attached to Sandusky County. Its eastern border is a
line dividing two different surveying systems, one extending east from the
Indiana line, and the other running west from the Pennsylvania line (the
western boundary of the Firelands). Seneca County, as originally defined,
included ranges 13 to 17 east in townships 1 to 3 north. Overlooked in this
description was the fractional range 18 east—the Seneca Gore. The legislature
never passed a law correcting this oversight, although the clear intention was
to include all territory up to the western boundary of the Firelands in Seneca
County, including fractional range 18 east. This is confirmed by the action of
Sandusky County officials who on 25 April 1820 created Thompson Township. The
township included part of Seneca County, and its eastern boundary was clearly
defined as the line of the Firelands, thus including the Seneca Gore in
Thompson Township and Seneca County.</p>

      <p>A second minor discrepancy involves an area of one
square mile between Morgan and Washington Counties—section 11 in township 8,
range 12—which appears to have been accidentally overlooked. Morgan gained
territory from Washington on 11 March 1845 and again on 14 February 1846. As a
result of these two boundary changes, section 11, which was part of Washington
County prior to 1845, technically was completely surrounded by Morgan County.
This oversight was never formally remedied, and the compiler has chosen to
correct it as of 1 April 1851, when Morgan again gained from Washington and the
present county line was established.</p>

      <p>A look at a present-day county map of Ohio reveals a
number of county lines in the southwestern part of the state that look as if
they should run due north-south, but actually tilt somewhat east of due north.
The county creation laws specify a “north line” or a “due north line,” but the
lines as surveyed in the early nineteenth century did not make sufficient
allowance for the variation of magnetic north (indicated by the surveyor’s
compass needle) from true north, thus the eastward slant. A number of these
lines were resurveyed over the years, but in most cases the lines were not
corrected to run to geographical north. One exception is the line between
Highland and Brown Counties. The county commissioners of the two counties
agreed to a resurvey in 1874, and the line was rotated counter-clockwise to run
closer to due north. This was the only county boundary change uncovered in Ohio
that took place outside the legislative process, although the authorization for
such a resurvey was given to county commissioners by an 1852 law (Ohio Laws
1852, 50th assy., gen., pp. 134–135). In this digital atlas, the
compiler has mapped these early county boundaries according to the lines as
surveyed, rather than following a literal interpretation of the wording of the
legislation.</p>

      <p><b>Sources</b></p>

      <p>Research on early Ohio laws was facilitated by the
three-volume <i>Statutes of Ohio and of the Northwestern Territory, Adopted or
Enacted from 1788 to 1833 Inclusive…</i> (1833–1835), edited by Salmon P.
Chase, who later served as Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court.
This careful re-publication of territorial and state laws missed only one
county boundary change involving Hamilton and Washington Counties on 11
February 1792. Citations to Chase are included in the consolidated chronology
and the individual county chronologies as an aid to users who may find Chase’s
compilation easier to locate than early nineteenth-century session laws.</p>

      <p>Collections of pertinent sections of county boundary
laws are convenient but demand caution. There is a potential for error in
transcription, as well as the possibility that valuable information (e.g., an
effective date) may be lost in the editorial process of excerpting the selected
passages. Such a compilation can be a marvelous convenience for the researcher,
once it has been checked against the session laws and has been found reliable.
There are compilations of county creations and changes for a number of states,
but they vary greatly in content and in accuracy. It is virtually impossible to
judge their reliability until much of the work has been replicated. These
secondary compilations, therefore, are useful chiefly as guides to the primary
laws, proclamations, and decisions. The “Evolution of Ohio County Boundaries” by
Randolph Chandler Downes in <i>Ohio Archaeological and Historical Quarterly</i>
(1927) proved to be a generally reliable secondary source for Ohio boundary
changes, although the laws are paraphrased and not reproduced in full. Even
though Downes conducted extensive research and correspondence in the course of
his work, the compiler of this digital atlas arrived at different
interpretations and depictions of a few county lines.</p>

      <p>In addition to Downes’s work, some other secondary
sources were particularly valuable in the compilation of Ohio county
boundaries. The Ohio Cooperative Topographic Survey, <i>Final Report</i>,
volumes 1 and 3 (reprint, 1972); William E. Peters’s <i>Ohio Lands and Their
History</i> (1930); and his article, “Tells Strange Story of Ohio’s Lost
Lands,” from the 21 December 1924 issue of the <i>Athens [Ohio] Messenger</i>
were important for understanding the various land survey systems used in Ohio,
the boundary controversy with Michigan, and some oddities of county creation.</p>

      <p>Among the most useful modern sources are the
large-scale (two miles to the inch), up-to-date county maps produced by the
Ohio Department of Transportation. These maps include individual surveyed
sections and were an important resource for boundaries, roads, natural
features, and other landmarks. </p>

      <p>One contemporary map deserves special mention.
Benjamin Hough and Alexander Bourne’s famous 1815 <i>Map of the State of Ohio
from Actual Survey</i> is a large-scale (five miles to the inch), beautifully
detailed work depicting all counties through early 1815, plus section lines and
numbered land lots in the area between the Little Miami and Scioto Rivers.
While there are a few minor errors on this map, it served as an important check
against the compiler’s mapping. The Newberry Library’s collection of nineteenth-century
county landownership maps, which were very popular in Ohio, was useful for
identifying roads, civil townships, and areas where small changes occurred or
were proposed.</p>

      <hr/>
     
      <p><b>Special Topics</b></p>

      <p>A series of
events in the 1780s laid the foundation in Pennsylvania for the northward and westward spread of Euro-American settlement, which was accompanied by the rapid creation of new counties. These included the settlement of territorial disputes with Virginia (1780) and Connecticut (1782) and the end of the War of the American Revolution (1783), as well as the final transfer to Pennsylvania of all claims to the northwestern quarter of the state by the Delaware, Iroquois, and Wyandot Indians (1784â€“1785) and the organization of the Northwest Territory (1787). From the early 1790s onward, the previously unsettled regions of the state offered land and opportunity in an administrative environment of relative stability and safety. Effective government and administration (especially that of the courts) were demanded by people whose migration to newly opened lands took them farther and farther from older settlements and established centers of
local government.</p>

      <p>While colonial and state officials generally respected Indian rights to the land and systematically purchased land from the Indian tribes, they ignored the various Indian purchase lines in creating new counties. County boundary lines usually were extended to the limits of the colony/state, and thus anticipated the migration of non-Indian settlers into northern and western Pennsylvania. In this atlas the boundary lines are drawn as described in the laws, with no allowance for the gradual purchase of Indian lands by colonial and state officials.</p>

      <p>Until a new state constitution went into effect in 1873, only the state legislature had the power to create new counties and to alter the boundaries of counties already in existence. One result was that the spatial organization and administration of local government were subject to frequent rearrangements and alterations, especially during the period between the end of the American Revolution and the Civil War.</p>

      <p>The Pennsylvania constitution of 1873 reflects one of the reform movements of the postâ€“Civil War era; it denied the state government the authority to enact special legislation, a category of lawmaking that had included the creation and alteration of local governmental units, including counties, as well as the passage of acts of incorporation for individual companies and the granting of pensions to individual veterans. The 1873 constitution required a comprehensive statute to provide for the creation of counties. It also stipulated that existing boundaries could be altered by local petition to, hearing in, and final judgment of the local courts of quarter sessions. By the early twentieth century, general acts had so circumscribed the changing of county boundaries with restrictions on area, size, population, and location that the county lines of Pennsylvania have been stable for nearly a century. The creation of Lackawanna County in 1878 was the last significant change in Pennsylvania's county boundaries.</p>

      <p>Shortly
after the turn of the nineteenth century, the Pennsylvania legislature on
several occasions created several counties in a single act, but then
temporarily attached the newly created counties to neighboring counties for
nearly all governmental purposes. In 1800, for instance, Erie, Mercer, Warren, and Venango counties were created, but attached to Crawford. These new "county districts," as they were later termed in similar legislation,
had to attain a certain population and select a county seat location (usually required to be very near the geographical center of the county) before they could be fully organized and elect their own county officers and operate their own courts and courthouses. Contemporaneous statutes termed this dependent status "annexed," but in other states and in more recent times the word "attached" has been employed; the latter, which describes more precisely the actual situation, is the term used in this atlas. Each
"county district" was a county; it had its own area with boundaries
described in the originating legislation, was listed separately in the
censuses, and had separate records for deeds to land within its bounds, even
though governmental functions were administered by officials of the county to which it was attached. Furthermore, residents having business at the courthouse had to travel to the county seat of the county to which their own was attached. In effect, every attached county, before becoming fully organized, had a county seat outside its own territory.</p>

      <p>Some boundary descriptions were based on the knowledge of local residents whose petitions initiated the changes. In the decades before accurate large-scale maps of Pennsylvania were available, legislators were severely handicapped by a lack of adequate geographic information. They had to depend on local information, which often was not very reliable. As a result, some boundary lines were vague or poorly defined and thus difficult to demarcate or to plot on a modern map. One legacy of this difficulty was the frequent readjustment of particular lines as the affected parties tried to achieve a satisfactory, well-defined boundary. The northeastern line of Centre County is an excellent example of this phenomenon; it was redefined and adjusted several times, sometimes directly and other times indirectly and possibly inadvertently.</p>

      <p>In one instance, the legislature rearranged the county lines for the sole purpose of ousting an unpopular legislator, John Franklin of Luzerne County. Many of Franklin's constituents had settled under the aegis of the Susquehannah Company and had supported Connecticut's attempt in the 1770s to take over what is now the northeastern part of Pennsylvania. In championing their cause Franklin angered many fellow legislators. To defeat him, the legislature in 1804 transferred the northwestern corner of Luzerne (around the East Branch of the Susquehanna River where Franklin lived) to Lycoming County, thus forcing Franklin into a new legislative district. Therefore, until 1810, when Ontario (now Bradford) County was created, Lycoming County was in two separate parts. (Franklin, incidentally, won reelection from his new district.)</p>

      <p>Several county boundaries were changed not by redrawing lines according to geographic features such as rivers and ridges, but by shifting minor civil divisions (e.g., townships) from one county to another. Extant records from the early decades of the nineteenth century do not always give a clear picture of those township lines, and it is often necessary to infer the configuration of the resulting county boundaries from later maps and descriptions.</p>

      <p>Occasionally, changes in the status of a municipality produced incidental changes in county lines. Such were the results in 1854 and 1855 of converting the townships of Jamestown (Mercer County) and Cherry Tree (Indiana County) to boroughs. Each of these townships was situated near a county line and had developed a functional area that extended across the county boundary. When each was incorporated as a borough, it annexed its peripheral areas, shifting the county lines to avoid splitting the borough among two or more counties.</p>

      <p>Sometimes, especially in the early nineteenth century, Pennsylvania county lines were not surveyed until long after they were described in the statute books. Such omissions were usually corrected later by the state, but the local people occasionally took matters into their own hands. For example, the line between Ontario (now Bradford) and Lycoming counties was not surveyed for some time; it ran through an area with rugged terrain and few people, and over the years the local residents developed an informal understanding of the boundary. Later attempts to survey the line according to the original description revealed how poorly some of the residents had understood the jurisdictional arrangements. The natural solution was to settle on a line that conflicted least with the de facto boundary that had developed over the years. This the local officials did, and then they secured state approval of their adjustment of the line.</p>

      <hr/>
     
      <p>Nearly all American states have defined their counties’
areas and limits as lines running from point to point or along specified
courses. These New England states are exceptions to that practice, for they
commonly defined their counties as groups of towns (incorporated
municipalities). In these states a purposeful change for a county was usually
accomplished by changing the mix of towns that composed it. Each of these
states also altered county areas and bounding lines as the consequence of changing
the lines separating towns on opposite sides of a county boundary; when county
boundaries were changed in this fashion that effect appeared inadvertent and
the affected counties often were never named. The method for discovering such
changes requires identifying neighboring cities and towns that could force a
county change and then searching for changes. For Massachusetts that task was
eased considerably by the Secretary of the Commonwealth’s <i>Historical Data
Relating to Counties, Cities, and Towns in Massachusetts</i> (1966), a
remarkably thorough and accurate listing of jurisdictional changes among
municipalities. A similar collection of data for Maine is <i>Counties, Cities,
Towns, and Plantations of Maine: A Handbook of Incorporations, Dissolutions,
and Boundary Changes</i> (1940), originally compiled and published by the
Historical Records Survey for that state.</p>

      <p>In 1763, as part of the peace agreement that ended the Seven
Years War, France and Great Britain established the northern limit of Maine as
the Atlantic–St. Lawrence River watershed, unchanged since then. Subsequent
disputes over Maine’s boundary concerned not its definition but its
implementation. Therefore, in this atlas the modern version of the boundary
line has been depicted from 1763 onward. Two important changes in Maine were
not clear and obvious from the standard sources. The first case concerned
Aroostook County, which extended across the northern cap of Maine in 1844.
Vague wording in the description of Aroostook’s southern limit could be interpreted
to run the county line through a line of western towns, but that would have
been contrary to the common practice of preserving the integrity of
municipalities, so the county boundary has been plotted along the town lines.
The second case involves the boundary that today separates the town of Detroit
in Somerset County from the town of Plymouth in Penobscot County. In 1790, this
county line ran straight north, cutting through several towns, including
Plymouth. Subsequent laws placed the other towns wholly in one county or the
other. However, there is no extant law that adjusted the line through Plymouth.
An act of 29 February 1844 incidentally mentioned that Detroit and Plymouth
were in different counties and implied that such an arrangement was of long
standing. Lacking other evidence, it appears that years before February 1844
officials and residents had adopted the town lines as the de facto county
lines, so in the chronology that change is dated “by” the date on which the
arrangement was so casually revealed. </p>

      <p><b>Dates</b></p>

      <p>Every effort has been made to give the day, month, and year (e.g., 25 February 1785)
for all county creations, boundary changes, and other events in this atlas.
Occasionally it is impossible to date an event so precisely, but a reasonable
estimate is possible. When the precise date is not known or an approximate date
is more appropriate, the date is generalized to the month and year (e.g.,
February 1785) or to the year alone. A lack of evidence may make it impossible
to give any date at all for a county's creation, and its occurrence can only be
confirmed by the record of a later, related happening, such as the appointment
of a sheriff. In such a situation, the date of the later event is used with the
simple addition of "by" (e.g., by 25 February 1785) to indicate that
the county creation or other event occurred no later than that date and
probably earlier.</p>

      <p>The dating standard in this atlas is the legally effective date of change, whether it be
for the creation of a new county or for the alteration of lines between
existing counties. Through the colonial period and into the nineteenth century,
the date a law passed was generally the date it went into effect. As the
nineteenth century progressed, legislators recognized the importance of
preparing for the establishment of a new county organization or for the shift
in jurisdiction that accompanies boundary changes. Some laws, therefore, began
to carry two dates: one marking the passage of the law and the other specifying
when the line change or new county creation would go into effect. If the date
of passage and effective date are different, the law gives both. Connecticut,
however, is an exception. For every county boundary change in Connecticut
before 1820, the date given here usually marks the beginning of the legislative
session. The sessions were short, dates of passage were not given in the
published records, and the opening date of the session is always available. </p>

      <p>Using effective dates means that many of the dates in this atlas may disagree with
dates in other references. As an aid to appreciating how great the differences
between the two dates can be and to help correlate this data with other
publications, this work gives both the date of passage and the effective date
for all county creations. While the maps are keyed to the effective date, a
notation is made in the chronologies giving the date of passage. For example, a
new county created by a law passed 15 January 1832, which did not take effect
until 1 July 1832, would not be mapped until 1 July. But the chronology would
include the entry: “Act passed 15 January 1832; took effect 1 July 1832.” </p>

      <p>Dating events before 1752 is a problem because the calendar then in use is very
different from the one in use today. Whereas by 1600 most of Europe had adopted
the Gregorian calendar, as the modern system of reckoning the days is called,
England observed the Julian calendar until 2 September 1752. For the purposes
of this atlas, the chief differences between the two systems are, first, numbering
the days and, second, designating the change from one year to the next. There
has been no attempt to convert the dates of one system to those of the other.
Differences in numbering days, therefore, are effectively ignored; whatever day
and month are given in a source are the day and month used here, regardless of
whether the document was written in England or some other country, before or
after 1752. Under the old, Julian calendar the last day of the year was 24
March and the first day was 25 March, which means that in England and its
colonies the day after 24 March 1750 was 25 March 1751. This atlas follows the
convention of showing both years for dates that fall within the period from 1
January through 24 March when the different calendars call for different years.
Thus, successive dates before England's adoption of the Gregorian calendar
would occur as follows: the day after 24 March 1688/1689 would be 25 March
1689; the day after 31 December 1689 would be 1 January 1689/1690. About three
months later would come 24 March 1689/1690, and the next day after that would
be 25 March 1690.</p>

      <p><b>Special Topics</b></p>

      <p>The first constitutional limits on the creation of new
counties in South Carolina were contained in the state constitution of 1868,
which required that the legislature ensure that new counties contain at least
625 square miles and that no existing county be reduced in area below 625
miles. These requirements were altered in the current constitution (adopted in
1895), which stipulates that new counties can be created when one-third of the
qualified voters in the area of the proposed new county petition the governor
for a new county, and two-thirds of the qualified voter in the same area
approve the creation in a subsequent election. If the voter reject the
creation, another election to create the same county cannot be held for four
years.</p>

      <p>The constitution further requires that the legislature, in
enabling legislation following approval by the voters, must ensure that new
counties contain at least 400 square miles, $1,500,000 of assessed taxable
property, and 1/124th of the state’s total inhabitants. Furthermore,
in the process of creating new counties, no existing county can be reduce to
less than 500 square miles in area, $2,000,000 of assessed taxable property, or
15, 000 inhabitants, and its boundaries must be at least eight miles distant
from its courthouse. The legislature also has the authority to alter the
boundaries of existing counties, provided the above four requirements for
existing counties are met and the voters in the affected areas approve by a
two-thirds majority.</p>

      <p>Several disputes involving these constitutional
requirements have been decided by the state supreme court. In 1899 the court
voided the initial creation of Lee County because two-thirds of the qualified
voters had not approved in that part of Darlington County to be included in the
new county. In 1902 Lee was created again, with slightly different boundaries.
The court upheld the creation of McCormick County in 1916, even though
Greenwood County (one of the counties from which McCormick was created) thereby
fell below the 500 square miles required by the constitution for existing
counties. The court ruled that Greenwood (created in 1897) was not covered by
the constitutional requirements for "old" counties, since it was
created after the 1895 constitution was adopted. The court also ruled that a
December 1914 Greenwood election, voided because many eligible voters were
denied the vote, did not count toward the four-year waiting period required by
the constitution; a valid election was held in December 1915.</p>

      <p>In another case involving the requirement that existing
counties contain at least 500 square miles, the court in 1951 upheld the
transfer of part of Beaufort County to Jasper County, rejecting the argument by
Beaufort officials that the transfer thereby reduced Beaufort below 500 square
miles of non-marsh or "high land." The court ruled that the word
"area" in the state constitution did not distinguish as to the
quality of such territory, that marshlands were included in the constitutional
definition of "area," and that the requirement that a county have at
least $2,000,000 of assessed taxable property after a reduction in size
answered the question of land quality. At the same time, the court declined to
uphold a referee's opinion that "area" also included inland waters,
since the constitutional requirement as to Beaufort's area was satisfied
without considering inland waters.</p>

      <p>In another case, the state supreme court ruled in 1921
that the legislature, in altering existing county boundaries, must enact any
boundary change exactly as approved by two-thirds of the qualified voters in
the affected area. The case involved a transfer of territory from Clarendon
County to Sumter County, in which more that one-third of the qualified
Clarendon voters in the affected area had petitioned for the transfer, and
two-thirds of them had approved in a subsequent election. However, before the
legislature approved enabling legislation, some Clarendon residents opposed to
the transfer produced their own survey of a revised boundary line and asked the
legislature to draw the new boundary according to their survey. The legislature
referred the matter to the supreme court, which declared that the legislature
had no authority under the constitution to alter the boundary line approved by
the voters.</p>

      <p>Counties, judicial districts, and parishes have served as
the basic units of local government at various times and places during South
Carolina's history. The historical boundaries of these units are mapped in this
atlas as they are recorded in the records of the Carolina Proprietors and
session laws of the legislature, without reference to the governmental role
each played at different times and places. However, it has been necessary in
some cases to supplement the maps with interpretative text to explain the
transition from one unit of government to another. For example, the boundaries
of the initial counties created in the late seventeenth century are mapped as
they appear in the official record. But they failed to develop as effective
units of government and were eventually supplanted by parishes and judicial
districts--although never officially abolished. To reflect this ambiguity in
status, the four counties are considered as "effectively eliminated"
when the colony was divided into seven judicial districts in 1769.</p>

      <p>A similar ambiguity accompanies the status of many of the
thirty-four counties created within the seven judicial districts in 1785. They
also failed to develop as functioning counties, and by 1791 the fourteen counties
created in the low country districts of Beaufort, Charleston, and Georgetown
had largely been abandoned. In that same year county government was suspended
in the four counties of Orangeburg District (Lewisburgh, Lexington, Orange, and
Winton), and those counties became, for all intents and purposes, defunct. In
this atlas, these eighteen counties are considered as being "effectively
eliminated" in 1791, even though their names survived in official records
for years thereafter.</p>

      <p>The remaining counties were absorbed into the judicial
district system in 1800, when twenty new judicial districts were created (and
five eliminated). From 1800 to 1868, then, the judicial districts were the
principal subdivisions of the state, with county and parish names surviving
mostly as geographical reference points. Finally, in 1868, a new state
constitution declared that the judicial districts were thereafter to be
"designated as counties" (Art. II, sec. 3), and they have remained
so.</p>

      <p>The ephemeral nature of many of South Carolina's counties
and judicial districts is reflected in the fact that eighteen counties and
districts have become extinct. In addition, two early incarnations of Berkeley
County, two early versions of Colleton County, two versions of Granville
County, and the original Marion County have also disappeared. Kingston and
Liberty counties were functioning counties for only a few years before they
became Horry and Marion districts, respectively.</p>

      <p>Parishes existed side-by-side with counties and judicial
districts from the early days of the colony to the Civil War, and even as their
functions dwindled parish names survived as geographical reference points. The
first parishes were created in the South Carolina low country in 1706 as
territorial units of the Church of England. But they gradually assumed many of
the functions of local government during the remainder of the eighteenth
century, and they continued to function as such well into the nineteenth
century. In some coastal areas, the parishes survived as election districts
until the Civil War. The judicial districts replaced all but two parishes (the
“late” parishes of St. Philip and St. Michael) as election districts in the
1865 state constitution, thus signaling the demise of the parishes as
functioning governmental units. (In this atlas the parishes are considered to
have been “effectively eliminated” on 27 September 1865, the date of completion
of the 1865 constitution). The 1868 state constitution completed the
transformation of local government when it stipulated that the judicial
districts were henceforth to be “designated as counties.”</p>

      <p>Some anomalies result from the ambiguities in the status
of governmental units outlined above. For example, in 1791 the legislature
essentially eliminated the four counties of Orangeburg District (Lewisburgh,
Lexington, Orange, and Winton) as operational units, yet in delineating the
boundaries of the area’s counties, election districts, and parishes in 1803 and
1805, the legislature continued to refer to the boundaries of the four
counties. However, it appears from the context of the two laws that the
reference to county lines was made primarily for the purpose of locating the
boundaries of election districts and parishes, not for altering the county
boundaries. The eclipse of the four counties is reflected in the fact that when
Barnwell District was created from Orangeburg District in 1800, the boundaries
of Orange and Winton counties were never altered to coincide with the new
district boundaries. Of the four original counties of Orangeburg District, only
Lexington survived to become a judicial district (in 1804), and it joined
Barnwell and Orangeburg districts in superseding the four counties. </p>

      <p>Similarly, two extinct counties, Claremont and Salem, pose
special interpretative problems. Salem was created from Claremont and Clarendon
counties in 1792, and those three counties made up Sumter District when Sumter
was created from Camden District in 1800. However, when Clarendon County was
established as a judicial district in 1857, the district boundaries were those
of the original Clarendon County of 1785--ignoring the creation of Salem County
in 1792. Although the law creating Clarendon District notes that Sumter District
was thereafter confined to Claremont County only, in this atlas Claremont and
Salem counties are considered as being "effectively eliminated" as
units of local government in 1800--when both counties became part of Sumter
District and failed to become districts in their own right.</p>

      <p>Another anomaly involves the boundaries of St. Bartholomew
Parish and the original Colleton County. When St. Bartholomew was created in
Colleton County in 1706, Colleton’s inland boundary had not yet been defined
(it is notated as an “estimated line” in this atlas), and thus St. Bartholomew
also had an undefined inland boundary. With the demise of the original Colleton
County in 1769 and the creation of a new Colleton County (in a different
location) in Charleston District in 1785, St. Bartholomew Parish was left with
an indefinite inland boundary. However, when Bartholomew County was created in
Charleston District in 1785, it had the same boundaries that St. Bartholomew
Parish would have had if its inland boundaries had been extended to the
Charleston / Organgeburg district line. In this
atlas, then, those parish boundaries are "implicitly extended" to
that district line in 1778, when the boundaries of three neighboring
low-country parishes (St. George–Dorchester, St. James–Goose Creek, and St.
John–Berkeley) were also extended to the district line by statute. (Bartholomew
County became extinct in 1791, while St. Bartholomew Parish continued as an
election district until 1865).</p>

      <p>Some imprecision in drawing the boundary lines of the
counties, judicial districts, and parishes is unavoidable, given the vagueness
and imprecision of many boundary descriptions, e.g., the "head" of a
creek or swamp or a line between river systems. Also, boundaries often involve
landmarks that cannot be identified today, e.g., the property of named
individuals, roads, marked trees, ferries, mills, and river landings. Finally,
some boundaries were ephemeral, disappearing completely in later boundary
changes and sometimes in existence for only a brief time. It is also apparent
that some county boundaries were not surveyed or clearly marked. In 1797, for
example, the legislature responded to a petition from some Fairfield and
Richland County residents, who asserted that the boundary separating the two counties
(both created in 1785) had never been run. Instead, another line--run
"some years ago"--was accepted by the residents as the boundary line,
and they asked the legislature to establish and run that "old" line
as the official boundary. The boundary established by the legislature in 1797
is significantly different from the line prescribed in 1785; in this atlas, the
1785 boundary is drawn according to the law creating the two counties, and the
boundary enacted by the legislature in 1797 is mapped as a change from that
1785 line.</p>

      <p>For many of the reasons mentioned above, some historical
county boundaries are conjectural; in this atlas they are notated as
"estimated lines" During the early years of county and parish
formation in South Carolina, some northern and western limits were left
undefined or extended to the limits of settlement; these are notated as an
"indefinite limit."</p>

      <p><b>Dates</b></p>

      <p>Every effort has been made to give the day, month, and
year (e.g., 25 February 1785) for all county creations, boundary changes, and
other events in this atlas. Occasionally it is impossible to date an event so
precisely, but a reasonable estimate is possible. When the precise date is not
known or an approximate date is more appropriate, the date is generalized to
the month and year (e.g., February 1785) or to the year alone. A lack of
evidence may make it impossible to give any date at all for a county's
creation, and its occurrence can only be confirmed by the record of a later,
related happening, such as the appointment of a sheriff. In such a situation,
the date of the later event is used with the simple addition of "by"
(e.g., by 25 February 1785) to indicate that the county creation or other event
occurred no later than that date and probably earlier. </p>

      <p>Several dates may be associated with the creation of a
county, judicial district, or parish or a change in boundaries. To many
individuals the date that makes the most sense is the one when people began to
observe the change, but in most cases that date is impossible to ascertain. An
alternative is the date on which the law effecting the change passed the
legislature or was approved by the governor. The date of passage is an
important reference because it helps identify the law; now, as in the past,
references to a law often include the date of passage. Most other compilations
of county changes have adopted the date of passage as their standard for the
date of change, but it is not always the best indicator of when change
occurred.</p>

      <p>The dating standard in this atlas is the legally effective
date of change, whether it be for the creation of a new unit of government or
for the alteration of lines between existing units. Through the colonial period
and into the nineteenth century, the date a law passed was generally the date
it went into effect. As the nineteenth century progressed, legislators
recognized the importance of preparing for the establishment of a new
governmental organization or for the shift in jurisdiction that accompanies
boundary changes. Some laws, therefore, began to carry two dates: one marking
the passage of the law and the other specifying when the boundary change would
go into effect. If the date of passage and effective date are different, the
law gives both. </p>

      <p>Using effective dates means that many of the dates in this
atlas may disagree with dates in other references. Dating events before 1752 is
a problem because the calendar then in use is very different from the one in
use today. Whereas by 1600 most of Europe had adopted the Gregorian calendar,
as the modern system of reckoning the days is called, England observed the
Julian calendar until 2 September 1752. For the purposes of this atlas, the
chief differences between the two systems are, first, numbering the days and,
second, designating the change from one year to the next. There has been no
attempt to convert the dates of one system to those of the other. Differences
in numbering days, therefore, are effectively ignored; whatever day and month
are given in a source are the day and month used here, regardless of whether
the document was written in England or some other country, before or after
1752. Under the old, Julian calendar the last day of the year was 24 March and
the first day was 25 March, which means that in England and its colonies the
day after 24 March 1750 was 25 March 1751. This atlas follows the convention of
showing both years for dates that fall within the period from 1 January through
24 March when the different calendars call for different years. Thus,
successive dates before England's adoption of the Gregorian calendar would
occur as follows: the day after 24 March 1688/1689 would be 25 March 1689; the
day after 31 December 1689 would be 1 January 1689/1690. About three months
later would come 24 March 1689/1690, and the next day after that would be 25
March 1690.</p>

      <hr/>
     
      <p>Prior to the establishment of the state of Tennessee in
1796, the territory that presently makes up the state was claimed, and in some
cases actually controlled, by several different entities: the Virginia Company
of London, the Lords Proprietors of Carolina, both the colony and later the
state of North Carolina, Spain, the state of Franklin, and the Territory of the
United States South of the River Ohio (Southwest Territory). Only North
Carolina and the Southwest Territory created operational counties within the
bounds of present Tennessee before statehood, all but one of which still exist
today. See below for an explanation of the counties authorized by the state of
Franklin.</p>

      <p>A number of factors make Tennessee one of the most
challenging and complicated states produced by the Atlas of Historical County
Boundaries Project. The first challenge is the large number of county boundary
changes. Most states recorded between 150 and 300 boundary changes and
creations throughout their histories. There are over 1,100 individual laws
creating or changing county boundaries in Tennessee. Putnam County alone
tallied over ninety different boundary changes. In the year 1889, the Tennessee
General Assembly passed fifty different laws concerning county boundaries; in
just one single day, 17 May 1915, the Assembly passed eighteen different county
boundary laws, possibly a national record.</p>

      <p>The second challenge relates to the type of boundary changes
set forth in the laws. About 900 of the 1,100 laws relate to “liners,” that is,
individual landowners who lived on or near the county boundary line and who
wished to have all their property consolidated in one county. Most states have
permitted little or no county boundary legislation that was explicitly designed
for the convenience of a single individual. In states where it has been allowed
to a limited extent, such as Kentucky or Alabama, the compilers of this series
have been able to locate most of these landowners and to mark the spot along a
boundary. That was impossible to do in Tennessee because most “liners” were
identified by name only, with no clue as to their location. Many of these
changes are so small that they would be visible only on a very large-scale map.
A typical example is found in the following 1905 law which detached one-eighth
of an acre from Benton County and attached it to Carroll County: 
<i>“Beginning  on a large cedar tree on the
county line runs [sic] east 48 feet to a plum tree; thence north 72 feet to a
plum tree; thence west 48 feet to the county line; thence with said county line
south 72 feet to the beginning, containing about one-eighth of an acre, so as
to detach from Benton County and attach to Carroll County the land upon which
is situated the residence and outbuildings of S.C. Walker”</i> (Tenn. Acts
1905, 54th assy., ch. 20/p. 53). In another instance, a line was run
25 feet down the center of the Porterfield Schoolroom, detaching half the
school from Rutherford County, and attaching it to Cannon County (Tenn. Acts
1891, 47<sup>th</sup> assy., ch. 254/p. 489).</p>

      <p>Legislators recognized the problems that such personalized
legislation presented and several attempts were made to limit or control such
changes, but they were unsuccessful and “liner” laws continued unabated. An
1895 law was designed to <i>“remedy this evil”</i> of transferring lands <i>“without
any diagram, plat, survey or measurement, [which] leads to much uncertainty and
difficulty in ascertaining where county lines really are,”</i> but little
seemed to change (Tenn. Acts 1895, 49th assy., ch. 105/p. 171).
Another result of this practice is the large number of legislative repeals in
which a county line is moved around the farm of a citizen one year and moved
back at some future date, often the very next session of the legislature. Liner
laws are still being passed at the end of the twentieth century. </p>

      <p>Changes made to accommodate local landowners, combined with
frequent decisions to run boundaries along mountain ridges, resulted in many
Tennessee counties having highly irregular boundaries. It has proved
practically impossible to tie each jog and turn in the modern line to a
specific piece of boundary legislation. However, every boundary law is listed,
both in the consolidated chronology and in the individual county chronologies,
regardless of whether it can be mapped or not. This atlas has mapped “liners”
and other small changes (if the location can be determined) as a small point or
dot along the boundary line. This file of small changes is not available on the
Tennessee interactive website maps. These changes are in a separate shapefile
that is part of the downloadable version of Tennessee, designed for use with
Geographic Information Systems (GIS).</p>

      <p>Because of the large number of unmappable changes in
Tennessee, it has several times been necessary to map aggregate changes in one
map that shows cumulative change over a period of time. For example, the modern
boundary between Wilson and Smith Counties was generally established in 1801,
but it experienced numerous small changes between 1860 and 1939. During those
seventy-nine years, there were eleven boundary changes in this line, but the
location of only three of the changes is known. Smith County, version 18 (dated
6 March 1939), depicts the net sum of changes in its boundary with Wilson
County from the first unmappable change in 1860 to 1939, when the last change
in the boundary occurred. Lacking an authoritative map or other source for the
shape of that line at intermediate dates, the depiction of cumulative change is
the approach least likely to present an error or to mislead users.</p>

      <p>The three Tennessee State Constitutions, 1796, 1835, and
1870, all set standards for the creation of new counties, such as minimum size,
minimum population, and proximity to adjacent county seats. Under the 1835
constitution, a new county was not allowed closer than twelve miles to an
existing county seat; this changed to eleven miles under the 1870 constitution.
Between 1835 and 1877, state legislators unsuccessfully tried to create
fourteen new counties in Tennessee. Some failed because voters in the affected
area voted against the new county, but in other cases legislators were unable
to carve a county out of an area while maintaining the required minimum size
and distance from nearby county seats. All proposed counties are mapped, with
the exception of Hatchee County, for which no boundary description was given in
the enabling law. Some of the proposed counties took on rather bizarre
proportions as legislators tried to work around the constitutional requirements
(see especially the long, thin Bell County, and the hourglass-shaped Etheridge
County). Two of today’s counties were created in almost the same places as two
of the unsuccessful proposals: Cheatham where original Cumberland would have
been located, and Chester where Wisdom County was proposed. Maps of the
proposed counties can be found on the interactive website maps in the layer
marked “Unsuccessful Proposals;” they are also available as part of the
downloadable shapefiles for Tennessee.</p>

      <p>Counties created in Tennessee by the state of Franklin in
the 1780s are particularly problematic. Delegates from the eastern Tennessee
country met in Jonesborough in 1784 to establish a new state that was not under
the jurisdiction of North Carolina, with the intention of petitioning the
United States Congress for admission to the Union. The General Assembly of
Franklin recognized the existing eastern Tennessee (then North Carolina)
counties of Greene, Sullivan, and Washington, and in 1784 and 1785 the state of
Franklin authorized the creation of five more counties. The acts have not
survived, and the precise boundary descriptions are unknown. North Carolina,
which then had jurisdiction over the Tennessee country, never recognized the
legitimacy of the state of Franklin and sought to regain control of the area.
The Franklin counties are included in the consolidated chronology, but no attempt
has been made to depict the counties or include them separately in the
individual county chronologies due to this lack of mappable boundary
descriptions. Rene Jordan, a local Tennessee scholar, has taken an alternative
approach in an attempt to reconstruct these counties in his articles on Hawkins
and Sumner Counties in <i>Tennessee Ancestors</i> (see Bibliography for 
complete citations).</p>

      <p>Tennessee legislators recognized the limits of their
geographical knowledge and therefore permitted surveyors quite a bit of freedom
in demarcating county boundaries. County creation laws often explicitly
authorized surveyors to alter lines if necessary as they prepared the original
plats, few of which appear to have survived. The law that created Cheatham
County in 1856, for example, specified taking territory from Dickson County,
but that did not happen because the surveyor determined that including part of
Dickson would reduce Dickson below its constitutional minimum size. He
explained: <i >“I would respectfully remark
that from the want of time I was unable to survey Dixon [sic] County before the
5th of Sept., the day appointed by law to ascertain the will of the
people in regard to the county of Cheatham, supposing that Dixon had at least
considerably over her constitutional complement of square miles, but, after
surveying Dixon I find her short 46.21 sqr. miles; consequently I have left out
the small fraction previously taken from her”</i> (Binkley, 31). Unfortunately,
this type of explicit evidence is rare, and most modifications by surveyors,
while recognizable, are not well documented.</p>

      <p>A look at the counties in Middle Tennessee in the early
1800s reveals a number of county lines that appear as though they should run
due north-south but actually tilt somewhat east of due north. The county
creation laws indeed specified “due north” or “due south” lines, but the
surveyors who marked those boundaries in the early nineteenth century did not
make enough allowance for the variation of magnetic north (indicated by the
compass needle) from true north, thus the eastward slant. This slant can still
be seen today in the eastern and western boundaries of Hickman County and the
eastern boundary of Dickson County.</p>

      <p>A predictable result of all the uncertainty surrounding
county lines was that many disputes arose and ended up in court. One can only
guess at the number of cases settled at the local court level, some of which,
no doubt, resulted in small shifts in the county lines that remain
undiscovered, despite the efforts of local historians and this research
project. However, a significant number of county boundary disputes progressed
all the way to the Tennessee State Supreme Court. Rulings of the State Supreme
Court have played an important role in the establishment of several county
lines and are cited in the chronologies.</p>

      <p>In 1972 the Tennessee General Assembly gave the State Board
of Equalization full authority to determine the location of county lines,
regardless of the reasons for a dispute. Boundaries can still be changed by
special legislation, or a landowner can have a change accepted by the assessors
of both counties. Changes made by the local assessors’ offices could not be
documented and included in this atlas. The State Board of Equalization records
changes and incorporates them on its current maps. The Board of Equalization
does not maintain a historical record of county boundary changes, and without a
centralized archive it is nearly impossible to find all locally generated
changes. In Tennessee, many county lines remain uncertain and the task of
reconciling boundaries between counties is likely to extend well into the
future.</p>

      <p>Research on early Tennessee laws was facilitated by <i>Laws 
of the State of Tennessee, Including
Those of North Carolina Now in Force in This State; From the Year 1715 to the
Year 1820, Inclusive,</i> compiled by Edward Scott and published in 1821. The
published series, <i >State Records of North
Carolina</i>, was also useful for identifying county creations and boundary
changes in Tennessee between 1777 and 1790, when the Tennessee country was
under the control of North Carolina. <i>Land Laws of Tennessee</i> (1891), 
compiled by Henry D. Whitney, has been considered
the authoritative guide to state laws on county creations and boundary changes.
However, a comparison against the state session laws revealed a number of
omissions in Whitney. While the volume is relatively complete up to the Civil
War, Whitney did not include some of the laws that changed county boundaries
for the convenience of “liners,” those people living on or near the county
line.</p>

      <p>The mapping of pre-1800 Tennessee county lines was made
easier due to the careful work done by Rene Jordan of the East Tennessee
Historical Society. His series of articles in <i >Tennessee Ancestors</i>, 
begun in 1994 (see Bibliography for a complete
listing), was invaluable, as was his willingness to share information and
ideas. While the renderings in this atlas do not agree in every instance or
detail with the sketches prepared by Jordan, there is broad general agreement
on the development of Tennessee counties before 1800.</p>

      <p>The number of large-scale or detailed nineteenth-century
maps of Tennessee is quite small, compared with other states, but one
historical map was critical for this project: Matthew Rhea’s 1832 “Map of the
State of Tennessee.” Based on Rhea’s own field surveys, it was the most
accurate map of Tennessee to that date. Although not officially sponsored or
sanctioned by the state, this map clearly took on quasi-official status. In
October 1832, the Tennessee General Assembly authorized funds to purchase
copies of Rhea’s map <i >“sufficient to
furnish one map to each of the colleges in East Tennessee, one to the Nashville
University, and one to each of the incorporated county academies of this State,
and one to each State of the United States”</i> (Tenn. Acts 1832, 19th assy., called 
sess., priv., ch. 93/p. 78). It appears that Rhea’s map was
consulted when new county boundaries were proposed. While his county lines
sometimes do not match the descriptions given in the state session laws, this
compiler has adopted his renderings, since they represent the accepted
boundaries of the time and because later changes were based on Rhea’s lines.</p>

      <hr/>
     
      <p><b>The Colonial Period</b></p>

      <p>In Virginia, the process of creating new counties was
established in 1634, when the colonial legislature created the first eight
counties, or “shires” as they were called. These represent the first counties
created in the North American colonies. Settlement spread upstream along the
major river systems and into western areas of the colony, and the legislature
accommodated the pioneers by detaching the eastern, or "lower," parts
of the existing counties and creating new counties in the western remainder. As
exploration and settlement advanced, the Blue Ridge Mountains gradually became
the accepted western boundary of new counties. It was not until 1735, when
Orange County was created, that territory in present West Virginia was specifically
included in Virginia county creations. The eastern, northern, and southern
boundaries were typically defined in the session laws, but the western limits
were largely undefined. </p>

      <p>The initial legislation named the first eight shires
but did not provide any boundary descriptions (Hening, <i>Statutes at Large</i>,
1:224). This project used boundary descriptions found in Lyon Gardiner Tyler’s,
<i>Cradle of the Republic</i> (1906), the source also used by Charles Francis
Cocke for his three volumes on the parishes of Virginia. According to Tyler, Charles City County was
bounded by the Appomattox River, Henrico County extended indefinitely westward,
and no boundary description was provided for Charles River (now York) County.
Since the mapping program used by this project does not allow for open-ended
counties, the western limit of these early counties is based on the head of the
Appomattox River. This ensures that all areas of early European settlement are
included within these estimated boundaries (Tanner, <i>Settling of North
America</i>, 46).</p>

      <p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Virginia relied
on its colonial charter of 1609 to claim vast areas of North America, including
all of the present states of Kentucky and West Virginia, part of Pennsylvania,
and everything east of the Mississippi River, north of the Ohio River, and
south of the Great Lakes. One way to exert jurisdiction over these areas was to
create counties, and this compilation includes all counties created by
Virginia, both within its modern boundaries, as well as those counties created
outside its current borders. For example, Kentucky was part of Virginia until
1792. In 1776, the Virginia legislature created Kentucky County, comprising all
of present Kentucky, and later carved nine of the state of Kentucky’s counties
from that original county. Virginia's creation in 1778 of the enormous Illinois
County encompassed all land claimed by Virginia north and west of the Ohio
River (all or part of six states); in 1784 Virginia ceded that territory to the
United States, which, in turn, created the Northwest Territory in 1787. The
overlapping of several Virginia counties (now in West Virginia) with western
Pennsylvania counties and the attempt by some North Carolinians in present
Tennessee to attach themselves to Virginia, reflect the reach of Virginia in
the colonial period. </p>

      <p>A pre-Revolutionary boundary line in what is now West
Virginia illustrates the challenges in mapping early counties. On January 31,
1770, Virginia created Botetourt County from Augusta County. The dividing line
ran easterly from the Blue Ridge Mountains to the head of “Carr’s Creek”
(Kerr’s Creek in modern Rockbridge County, Virginia), “thence north fifty-five
degrees west, as far as the courts of the two counties shall extend it” (Hening,
8:396). This fifty-five degree line extended over one hundred twenty-five miles
across all of modern West Virginia to the Ohio River and remained part of the
boundary of numerous counties until 1856 when Roane County was created. The
southern end of a line running at the prescribed angle through the source of
Kerr’s Creek matches up with the small (mile long) “notch” that still exists
between Webster and Pocahontas Counties, West Virginia, and the entire line
fits the requirements of several boundary descriptions prescribed for other
counties in the 1820s and 1830s. Sharp-eyed readers will notice that this line
lies about five miles north of the line Edgar Barr Sims plotted for this
boundary in the maps of historical West Virginia counties that he published in
the 1950s. The compilers nearly always have agreed with Sims’s versions of the
old boundaries, but in this case they believe the evidence favors the version
rendered here. </p>

      <p><b>Creating New Counties</b></p>

      <p>As in other states, creating and changing counties in
Virginia is the responsibility of the legislature. Until 1851 there were no
constitutional limits on county creations in Virginia. The state constitution
of 1851 required (1) that new counties contain at least 600 square miles; (2)
that the counties from which they were created not be reduced below 600 square
miles by such creations; (3) that no county with less than 5,000 white
residents could be deprived of more than one-fifth of its population; and (4)
that no county with more than 5,000 white residents could be reduced below
4,000. The constitution of 1864 continued these restrictions, whereas the
constitution of 1870 changed only the population requirements: no county with
less than 10,000 population could be deprived of more than one-fifth of its population,
and no county with more than 10,000 population could be reduced below 8,000.
The constitution of 1902 maintained the population stipulation that no county
could be reduced below 8,000 inhabitants. The 1971 state constitution has no
restrictions on county size or population. </p>

      <p>West Virginia broke away from Virginia in 1861, but was not
admitted to the Union as a separate state until 20 June1863. Most county
creations and changes in present West Virginia occurred prior to 1863 under the
authority of the Virginia legislature. The basic process of creating new
counties that was established by Virginia was continued by West Virginia. The
West Virginia state constitution of 1861 required that each new county, and the
counties from which it was taken, have at least 400 square miles and 4,000
white residents; the current constitution (1872) raised the resident
requirement to 6,000, and stipulated further that no new county could be formed
without the consent of a majority of the voters residing within the boundaries
of the proposed new county. These constitutional provisions complicated the
process of creating new counties. For example, the boundaries of Lincoln County
(created in 1867, from four counties) were altered, redefined, and clarified
six times before 1955, when the legislature again "defined and
established" Lincoln's boundaries. </p>

      <p>The many legal boundary adjustments, clarifications, and
redefinitions in both Virginia and West Virginia reflect the rapidly expanding
population and often inadequate geographical knowledge that lay behind those
changes. The laws frequently defined boundaries that ran along mountain ridges,
between river systems, and to the "heads" of rivers or
streams—directions too often vague and imprecise. Also, county boundaries often
involved landmarks that cannot be identified today, e.g., the property of named
individuals, roads, water fords, ferries, mills, and river landings. Finally,
some boundaries were ephemeral, disappearing completely in later boundary
changes and sometimes in existence for only a brief time. Judging by the many
boundary disputes and the stated reasons for specific boundary changes, it also
is apparent that many county boundaries were not surveyed or clearly marked.
For these reasons, some historical county boundaries are unavoidably
conjectural. Such lines are considered to be “estimated lines,” and are noted
as such in the attribute table, but cannot be so marked on the <i>Interactive
Map</i>.</p>

      <p><b>Independent Cities in Virginia</b></p>

      <p>The 1902 state constitution authorized the establishment of
independent cities, a phenomenon found only in Virginia, Maryland, Missouri,
and Nevada. Virginia created a total of forty-five independent cities, some of
which have become extinct or reverted to town status. Initially, cities were
divided into two classes: first-class cities (more than 10,000 population) were
completely autonomous and operated in all respects like counties; second-class
cities (5,000–10,000 population) had all the powers of first-class cities,
except that they did not have a court system separate from the county in which
they were located. Since 1902, most territorial changes between independent
cities and counties have been gains by the cities from the counties. Conflict
has developed between cities, which generally wished to expand, and counties,
which wanted to protect and maintain their territory. Since the 1980s,
additions to the Virginia Code have made it more difficult for independent
cities to engage in hostile annexations of county territory, and the number of
boundary changes had slowed, but not completely stopped, by 2000.</p>

      <p>Mapping the independent cities creates special problems
because the annexation process by which these cities expand principally is
based on judicial rather than legislative proceedings, and the amount of land
involved is often very small. There appears to be no single, comprehensive
repository that recorded all independent city annexations, and the Atlas of Historical
County Boundaries Project has gathered information from various sources. For
annexations from 1902 to the mid-1960s, the compilers relied on Chester W.
Bain’s, <i>Annexation in Virginia</i> (1966). Additional information was
acquired from the U.S. Census Bureau, Virginia county and city officials, and
from the Virginia Commission on Local Government, which is charged with
developing “advisory reports on local boundary change and governmental
transition issues for localities and the courts.” Despite these efforts, the
compilers suspect there may be some omissions.</p>

       <p><b>Sources</b></p>

      <p>From the early years of Virginia’s existence, virtually all
boundary changes were made by the legislature. The laws for the period 1619
(the meeting of the first legislature) through 1792 were collected by William
W. Hening and published in thirteen volumes of <i>Statutes at Large; Being a
Collection of All the Laws of Virginia, from the First Session of the
Legislature in the Year 1619 [to 1792]</i>. Published in Richmond, 1819–1823,
they have become a classic and a standard. Hening's pioneering work was
continued by Samuel Shepherd, who carried the series through the 1807–1808
session. Some additional laws, not in Hening (or in Hening by title only), are
printed in Morgan P. Robinson, <i>Virginia Counties: Those Resulting from
Virginia's Legislation</i> (1916), and Waverly K. Winfree, ed., <i>Laws of
Virginia: Being a Supplement to Hening's Statutes at Large, 1700–1750</i>
(1971). Hening does not include the dates of passage for laws approved before
1787; in this compilation those dates are taken from Robinson’s, <i>Virginia
Counties</i>. Early laws related to counties now in Kentucky and West Virginia,
but created by Virginia, are also included in Hening.</p>

      <p>A number of secondary works were valuable in the compilation
of Virginia and West Virginia county boundaries. Michael F. Doran, <i>Atlas of
County Boundary Changes in Virginia, 1634–1895</i> (1987), has maps, by decade;
while Edgar B. Sims, <i>Map of Present State of West Virginia</i> (1954), has
nine maps showing county boundary changes by decade, from 1769 to the present.
Sims's <i>Making a State</i> (1956) has a valuable index and summary of county
boundary changes in West Virginia, supplemented by ten maps (essentially the
same maps as in his <i>Map of Present State</i>...). For background on the
Virginia independent cities, see Chester W. Bain, <i>Annexation in Virginia:
The Use of the Judicial Process for Readjusting City-County Boundaries</i>
(1966), and Bain, <i>"A Body Incorporate": The Evolution of
City-State Separation in Virginia</i> (1967). For parish boundaries, Charles
Francis Cocke's three volumes are invaluable: <i>Parish Lines: Diocese of
Southwestern Virginia</i> (1960); <i>Parish Lines: Diocese of Southern Virginia</i>
(1964); and <i>Parish Lines: Diocese of Virginia</i> (1967).</p>

      <p>Historical maps do not frequently play a large role in this
sort of work. Occasionally they are indispensable for lost landmarks and names
no longer in use, but seldom for interpretations of boundary descriptions. A
useful modern source was the large-scale, up-to-date county map collection
published by the Virginia Department of Transportation, <i>County Road Map
Atlas</i> (1987). These maps are reliable compilations of the details of
boundaries, roads, natural features, and other landmarks.</p>

      <p><b>Dates</b></p>

      <p>Every effort has been made to give the day, month, and year
(e.g., 25 February 1785) for all county creations, boundary changes, and other
events. Occasionally it is impossible to date an event so precisely, but a
reasonable estimate is possible. When the precise date is not known or an approximate
date is more appropriate, the date is generalized to the month and year (e.g.,
February 1785) or to the year alone. A lack of evidence may make it impossible
to give any date at all for a county's creation, and its occurrence can only be
confirmed by the record of a later, related happening, such as the appointment
of a sheriff. In such a situation, the date of the later event is used with the
simple addition of "by" (e.g., by 25 February 1785) to indicate that
the county creation or other event occurred no later than that date and
probably earlier. The dating standard used is the legally effective date of
change, whether it be for the creation of a new county or for the alteration of
lines between existing counties.</p>

      <p>Dating events before 1752 is a problem because the calendar
then in use is very different from the one in use today. Whereas by 1600 most
of Europe had adopted the Gregorian calendar, as the modern system of reckoning
the days is called, England observed the Julian calendar until 2 September
1752. Under the old Julian calendar the last day of the year was 24 March and
the first day was 25 March, which means that in England and its colonies,
including Virginia, the day after 24 March 1750 was 25 March 1751. In its
databases this project uses the modern, Gregorian year for dates that fall
within the period from 1 January through 24 March, because software cannot
handle dual-year dates. But dual dates are cited in the text portion of an
entry, since original documents may record the date according to the Julian
calendar. Thus the date, 1 January 1735, may appear in the “Date” column of the
attribute table and database, but the descriptive entry for that date would
show the date as 1 January 1734/1735, indicating that people of the time still considered
this date to be in the year 1734.</p>

      <hr/>
     
      <p>Between the Appalachian
Mountains and the Mississippi River, the United States installed a succession
of territorial governments for the lands formerly claimed by some of the
original thirteen states on the basis of their colonial charters. The state of
Wisconsin developed out of this network of federal territories. The area within
present Wisconsin was claimed by Virginia under its colonial charter and was
incorporated into Virginia’s Illinois County (1778–1784). After Virginia ceded
its charter claims to the United States in 1784, the area of present Wisconsin
was part of the Northwest Territory (1787–1800) and the territories of Indiana
(1800–1809), Illinois (1809–1818), and Michigan (1818–1836). Wisconsin
Territory (1836–1848) initially included all of present Wisconsin, Iowa, and
Minnesota, as well as parts of North and South Dakota. The maps in this digital
atlas show all of the state, territorial, and county configurations under these
various jurisdictions.</p>

      <p><b>Sources</b></p>

      <p>Virtually all boundary
changes in Wisconsin have been made by the successive legislatures that
controlled the area. <i>The Territorial Papers of the United States, </i>which
include acts passed by the territorial legislatures as well as decrees by
territorial governors, are an indispensable source for tracing Wisconsin's
territorial history. The session laws for Wisconsin Territory (1836–1848), <i>Laws
of the Territory of Wisconsin</i>, and for the state of Wisconsin, <i>Laws of
Wisconsin</i>, are available in most law libraries in printed volumes and in
microform. These sources are supplemented by specialized collections cited in
the citations and bibliography.</p>

      <p>There are compilations of
county creations and changes for a number of states, including one for
Wisconsin, but they vary greatly in content and in accuracy. In <i>Origin and
Legislative History of County Boundaries in Wisconsin, </i>produced by the Wisconsin
Historical Records Survey in 1942, many boundary changes are summarized rather
than transcribed as enacted, and a number of maps contain serious errors. That
secondary compilation, therefore, is useful chiefly as a guide to the primary
laws, proclamations, and decisions. Except for the <i>Historical Atlas of
Wisconsin</i> (1878), which has detailed county maps and provides a good
overview of each county's organization and early history, secondary works were
of limited value in the compilation of this work.</p>

      <p><b>Foundations of County Boundaries</b></p>

      <p>Wisconsin's land was once
part of the national public domain and, as such, it was divided for sale
according to the federal rectangular survey system. Although the earliest
county creations and boundary changes in present Wisconsin were based
principally on river systems and extended arbitrary lines, lawmakers quickly
recognized the utility of basing boundaries on the survey system, and the
Wisconsin territorial legislature began incorporating range, township, and
section lines into county boundary descriptions when it first started creating
counties in 1836; the practice has continued to the present time. </p>

      <p>The state constitution of
1848 (still in effect, as amended) stipulates that no county containing 900
square miles or less may be reduced in size without the approval of a majority
of the county's legal voters (Article XIII, section 7). In 1857 the state
supreme court cited this constitutional requirement in striking down an 1856
law that transferred the five southernmost townships of Dodge County to
Jefferson County. The court noted that the transfer reduced Dodge from 900 to
720 square miles, and therefore the county was required to hold an election to
win approval of the transfer, which it had failed to do.</p>

      <p>The practice of submitting
proposed boundary changes to the voters for approval began in 1846 when
Milwaukee County voters approved the creation of Waukesha County, and at the
same time Dodge and Jefferson County voters rejected creation of a new, unnamed
county from their two counties. Since then the legislature has submitted some
twenty proposed boundary changes to the voters. Most of the referenda were
binding; that is, the proposed boundary change took effect only if the voters
approved. One exception was the purely advisory referendum, when Iowa County
voters were asked in 1846 if they wanted Iowa divided into Lafayette and
Montgomery Counties. The voters approved, but the next year the legislature
created only Lafayette County and retained the name of Iowa for the remainder
of the original Iowa County. In 1850, in a binding referendum, Washington
County voters rejected creation of another new county, named Tuskola.</p>

      <p>In a few cases the
referendum was part of a two-step process, as when Adams County voters approved
the creation of Juneau County in a November 1855 referendum, and the
legislature then officially created Juneau County, effective 1 January 1857.
The creation of Green Lake County from Marquette County in 1858, and subsequent
boundary adjustments, required four referenda. In April 1858, Marquette voters
approved the creation of Green Lake County, with specified boundaries, but the
next month the legislature repealed the act providing for that referendum, drew
new boundaries, and again referred the question to the voters. Following a
boundary change in 1860, the legislature later submitted proposed boundary
changes to the voters of Green Lake and Marquette Counties in 1862 and
1865—both of which were rejected. Angry Shawano County residents blocked one scheduled
referendum in 1883, when the legislature proposed transferring six and
one-third townships from Shawano to Langlade County. Despite this disapproval
by Shawano County voters, legislators again enacted the change at the next
legislative session in 1885—this time without the referendum requirement.</p>

      <p>Many counties were created
in Wisconsin before there was adequate population to support them. The
legislature therefore devised a system of attachments, whereby newly created
counties were attached to fully operational counties, generally for judicial
purposes only. In some cases, however, newly created counties went through a
three-step process. Sheboygan and Manitowoc Counties, for example, were (1)
created in 1836 and attached to Brown “for judicial purposes,” (2) organized
“for all the purposes of county government” in 1839 (while remaining attached
to Brown for judicial purposes), and (3) freed from their judicial attachments
to Brown and made fully functioning counties in 1846 and 1848, respectively. In
several instances, counties that were once fully functioning were attached (or
reattached) to other counties for all county purposes or just for judicial
purposes. All of these organizations and attachments are noted in the
consolidated chronology and individual county chronologies of this atlas.</p>

      <p>In the words of the state
session laws, unorganized counties could be attached to fully organized
counties for a variety of reasons, including “judicial purposes,” “county and
judicial purposes,” “temporary purposes,” etc. While it is beyond the scope of
this project to explain the precise meaning of each phrase at various points in
time, the differences in terminology may be important to researchers.
Therefore, when the purpose of the attachment is stated in the law, it is
quoted (e.g., “for judicial purposes”) in both the consolidated chronology and
the individual county chronologies.</p>

      <p><b>Problems</b></p>

      <p>Occasionally, through some
oversight or error in the legislative process, townships or parts of townships
were assigned to two adjoining counties. When Dodge and Portage Counties were
created in 1836, the western part of Dodge overlapped the eastern part of
Portage (an area eventually awarded to Dodge in 1838). Similarly, Fond du Lac
and Marquette Counties overlapped each other when created in 1836, as did St.
Croix and LaPointe (now Bayfield) following a boundary change in 1849. These
&quot;overlap areas” are mapped in the digital atlas so users can clearly
identify the territory in question.</p>

      <p>Just as the legislature created some overlaps through
oversight or error, it also left several gaps between existing counties—areas
that were not assigned to any county. In this digital atlas, such gores or
unassigned areas are treated as non-county areas (rather than as remnants of
the original county) at the time of the relevant boundary changes. For example,
when Rock County was created from Milwaukee County in 1836, the five
westernmost townships of present Rock and the five easternmost townships of
present Green were left between Iowa and Milwaukee Counties, outside the bounds
of any county. The legislature clearly intended to sever them from Milwaukee,
and the compilers of this atlas have treated the townships as non-county area,
rather than as remnants of Milwaukee County. In 1837 the five western townships
became part of Green County; in 1838 the eastern five were added to Rock
County, eliminating the non-county area. Each non-county area is assigned a
number by the compiler and digitizer (e.g., Non-County Area 5). Numbers are
assigned in chronological order and are simply a convenience to aid users in
keeping track of different non-county areas.</p>

      <p>In the 1850s the county
affiliation of the five eastern townships of Portage County was unclear. The
townships remained part of Winnebago County when Outagamie and Waupaca Counties
were created from Brown and Winnebago Counties on 17 February 1851. On 27
February 1851 the legislature transferred the five townships to Portage County.
However, in March 1855 the legislature authorized Winnebago residents to vote
in their annual town meeting whether they wanted Winnebago County to retain the
five townships; a week later the same legislators authorized residents of the
townships to choose between Portage and Waupaca. Even though voters chose
Waupaca County in an August 1855 referendum, the townships remained part of
Portage. (The compilers have found no evidence that Winnebago County voters
considered the matter.) From the available evidence, it appears that once the
five townships were transferred from Winnebago County to Portage on 27 February
1851, they remained there ever since.</p>

      <p>The present boundary
between Green Lake and Marquette Counties deviates in two small places from the
legal description. The discrepancy occurred in 1860, when a boundary adjustment
between the two counties was demarcated differently from the description in the
law. The boundary as demarcated is well known and has been accepted by area
residents; it is mapped that way in this atlas.</p>

      <hr/>
     
      <p><b>The Colonial Period</b></p>

      <p>In Virginia, the process of creating new counties was
established in 1634, when the colonial legislature created the first eight
counties, or “shires” as they were called. These represent the first counties
created in the North American colonies. Settlement spread upstream along the
major river systems and into western areas of the colony, and the legislature
accommodated the pioneers by detaching the eastern, or "lower," parts
of the existing counties and creating new counties in the western remainder. As
exploration and settlement advanced, the Blue Ridge Mountains gradually became
the accepted western boundary of new counties. It was not until 1735, when
Orange County was created, that territory in present West Virginia was specifically
included in Virginia county creations. The eastern, northern, and southern
boundaries were typically defined in the session laws, but the western limits
were largely undefined. </p>

      <p>The initial legislation named the first eight shires
but did not provide any boundary descriptions (Hening, <i>Statutes at Large</i>,
1:224). This project used boundary descriptions found in Lyon Gardiner Tyler’s,
<i>Cradle of the Republic</i> (1906), the source also used by Charles Francis
Cocke for his three volumes on the parishes of Virginia. According to Tyler, Charles City County was
bounded by the Appomattox River, Henrico County extended indefinitely westward,
and no boundary description was provided for Charles River (now York) County.
Since the mapping program used by this project does not allow for open-ended
counties, the western limit of these early counties is based on the head of the
Appomattox River. This ensures that all areas of early European settlement are
included within these estimated boundaries (Tanner, <i>Settling of North
America</i>, 46).</p>

      <p>In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Virginia relied
on its colonial charter of 1609 to claim vast areas of North America, including
all of the present states of Kentucky and West Virginia, part of Pennsylvania,
and everything east of the Mississippi River, north of the Ohio River, and
south of the Great Lakes. One way to exert jurisdiction over these areas was to
create counties, and this compilation includes all counties created by
Virginia, both within its modern boundaries, as well as those counties created
outside its current borders. For example, Kentucky was part of Virginia until
1792. In 1776, the Virginia legislature created Kentucky County, comprising all
of present Kentucky, and later carved nine of the state of Kentucky’s counties
from that original county. Virginia's creation in 1778 of the enormous Illinois
County encompassed all land claimed by Virginia north and west of the Ohio
River (all or part of six states); in 1784 Virginia ceded that territory to the
United States, which, in turn, created the Northwest Territory in 1787. The
overlapping of several Virginia counties (now in West Virginia) with western
Pennsylvania counties and the attempt by some North Carolinians in present
Tennessee to attach themselves to Virginia, reflect the reach of Virginia in
the colonial period. </p>

      <p>A pre-Revolutionary boundary line in what is now West
Virginia illustrates the challenges in mapping early counties. On January 31,
1770, Virginia created Botetourt County from Augusta County. The dividing line
ran easterly from the Blue Ridge Mountains to the head of “Carr’s Creek”
(Kerr’s Creek in modern Rockbridge County, Virginia), “thence north fifty-five
degrees west, as far as the courts of the two counties shall extend it” (Hening,
8:396). This fifty-five degree line extended over one hundred twenty-five miles
across all of modern West Virginia to the Ohio River and remained part of the
boundary of numerous counties until 1856 when Roane County was created. The
southern end of a line running at the prescribed angle through the source of
Kerr’s Creek matches up with the small (mile long) “notch” that still exists
between Webster and Pocahontas Counties, West Virginia, and the entire line
fits the requirements of several boundary descriptions prescribed for other
counties in the 1820s and 1830s. Sharp-eyed readers will notice that this line
lies about five miles north of the line Edgar Barr Sims plotted for this
boundary in the maps of historical West Virginia counties that he published in
the 1950s. The compilers nearly always have agreed with Sims’s versions of the
old boundaries, but in this case they believe the evidence favors the version
rendered here. </p>

      <p><b>Creating New Counties</b></p>

      <p>As in other states, creating and changing counties in
Virginia is the responsibility of the legislature. Until 1851 there were no
constitutional limits on county creations in Virginia. The state constitution
of 1851 required (1) that new counties contain at least 600 square miles; (2)
that the counties from which they were created not be reduced below 600 square
miles by such creations; (3) that no county with less than 5,000 white
residents could be deprived of more than one-fifth of its population; and (4)
that no county with more than 5,000 white residents could be reduced below
4,000. The constitution of 1864 continued these restrictions, whereas the
constitution of 1870 changed only the population requirements: no county with
less than 10,000 population could be deprived of more than one-fifth of its population,
and no county with more than 10,000 population could be reduced below 8,000.
The constitution of 1902 maintained the population stipulation that no county
could be reduced below 8,000 inhabitants. The 1971 state constitution has no
restrictions on county size or population. </p>

      <p>West Virginia broke away from Virginia in 1861, but was not
admitted to the Union as a separate state until 20 June1863. Most county
creations and changes in present West Virginia occurred prior to 1863 under the
authority of the Virginia legislature. The basic process of creating new
counties that was established by Virginia was continued by West Virginia. The
West Virginia state constitution of 1861 required that each new county, and the
counties from which it was taken, have at least 400 square miles and 4,000
white residents; the current constitution (1872) raised the resident
requirement to 6,000, and stipulated further that no new county could be formed
without the consent of a majority of the voters residing within the boundaries
of the proposed new county. These constitutional provisions complicated the
process of creating new counties. For example, the boundaries of Lincoln County
(created in 1867, from four counties) were altered, redefined, and clarified
six times before 1955, when the legislature again "defined and
established" Lincoln's boundaries. </p>

      <p>The many legal boundary adjustments, clarifications, and
redefinitions in both Virginia and West Virginia reflect the rapidly expanding
population and often inadequate geographical knowledge that lay behind those
changes. The laws frequently defined boundaries that ran along mountain ridges,
between river systems, and to the "heads" of rivers or
streams—directions too often vague and imprecise. Also, county boundaries often
involved landmarks that cannot be identified today, e.g., the property of named
individuals, roads, water fords, ferries, mills, and river landings. Finally,
some boundaries were ephemeral, disappearing completely in later boundary
changes and sometimes in existence for only a brief time. Judging by the many
boundary disputes and the stated reasons for specific boundary changes, it also
is apparent that many county boundaries were not surveyed or clearly marked.
For these reasons, some historical county boundaries are unavoidably
conjectural. Such lines are considered to be “estimated lines,” and are noted
as such in the attribute table, but cannot be so marked on the <i>Interactive
Map</i>.</p>

      <p><b>Independent Cities in Virginia</b></p>

      <p>The 1902 state constitution authorized the establishment of
independent cities, a phenomenon found only in Virginia, Maryland, Missouri,
and Nevada. Virginia created a total of forty-five independent cities, some of
which have become extinct or reverted to town status. Initially, cities were
divided into two classes: first-class cities (more than 10,000 population) were
completely autonomous and operated in all respects like counties; second-class
cities (5,000–10,000 population) had all the powers of first-class cities,
except that they did not have a court system separate from the county in which
they were located. Since 1902, most territorial changes between independent
cities and counties have been gains by the cities from the counties. Conflict
has developed between cities, which generally wished to expand, and counties,
which wanted to protect and maintain their territory. Since the 1980s,
additions to the Virginia Code have made it more difficult for independent
cities to engage in hostile annexations of county territory, and the number of
boundary changes had slowed, but not completely stopped, by 2000.</p>

      <p>Mapping the independent cities creates special problems
because the annexation process by which these cities expand principally is
based on judicial rather than legislative proceedings, and the amount of land
involved is often very small. There appears to be no single, comprehensive
repository that recorded all independent city annexations, and the Atlas of Historical
County Boundaries Project has gathered information from various sources. For
annexations from 1902 to the mid-1960s, the compilers relied on Chester W.
Bain’s, <i>Annexation in Virginia</i> (1966). Additional information was
acquired from the U.S. Census Bureau, Virginia county and city officials, and
from the Virginia Commission on Local Government, which is charged with
developing “advisory reports on local boundary change and governmental
transition issues for localities and the courts.” Despite these efforts, the
compilers suspect there may be some omissions.</p>

       <p><b>Sources</b></p>

      <p>From the early years of Virginia’s existence, virtually all
boundary changes were made by the legislature. The laws for the period 1619
(the meeting of the first legislature) through 1792 were collected by William
W. Hening and published in thirteen volumes of <i>Statutes at Large; Being a
Collection of All the Laws of Virginia, from the First Session of the
Legislature in the Year 1619 [to 1792]</i>. Published in Richmond, 1819–1823,
they have become a classic and a standard. Hening's pioneering work was
continued by Samuel Shepherd, who carried the series through the 1807–1808
session. Some additional laws, not in Hening (or in Hening by title only), are
printed in Morgan P. Robinson, <i>Virginia Counties: Those Resulting from
Virginia's Legislation</i> (1916), and Waverly K. Winfree, ed., <i>Laws of
Virginia: Being a Supplement to Hening's Statutes at Large, 1700–1750</i>
(1971). Hening does not include the dates of passage for laws approved before
1787; in this compilation those dates are taken from Robinson’s, <i>Virginia
Counties</i>. Early laws related to counties now in Kentucky and West Virginia,
but created by Virginia, are also included in Hening.</p>

      <p>A number of secondary works were valuable in the compilation
of Virginia and West Virginia county boundaries. Michael F. Doran, <i>Atlas of
County Boundary Changes in Virginia, 1634–1895</i> (1987), has maps, by decade;
while Edgar B. Sims, <i>Map of Present State of West Virginia</i> (1954), has
nine maps showing county boundary changes by decade, from 1769 to the present.
Sims's <i>Making a State</i> (1956) has a valuable index and summary of county
boundary changes in West Virginia, supplemented by ten maps (essentially the
same maps as in his <i>Map of Present State</i>...). For background on the
Virginia independent cities, see Chester W. Bain, <i>Annexation in Virginia:
The Use of the Judicial Process for Readjusting City-County Boundaries</i>
(1966), and Bain, <i>"A Body Incorporate": The Evolution of
City-State Separation in Virginia</i> (1967). For parish boundaries, Charles
Francis Cocke's three volumes are invaluable: <i>Parish Lines: Diocese of
Southwestern Virginia</i> (1960); <i>Parish Lines: Diocese of Southern Virginia</i>
(1964); and <i>Parish Lines: Diocese of Virginia</i> (1967).</p>

      <p>Historical maps do not frequently play a large role in this
sort of work. Occasionally they are indispensable for lost landmarks and names
no longer in use, but seldom for interpretations of boundary descriptions. A
useful modern source was the large-scale, up-to-date county map collection
published by the Virginia Department of Transportation, <i>County Road Map
Atlas</i> (1987). These maps are reliable compilations of the details of
boundaries, roads, natural features, and other landmarks.</p>

      <p><b>Dates</b></p>

      <p>Every effort has been made to give the day, month, and year
(e.g., 25 February 1785) for all county creations, boundary changes, and other
events. Occasionally it is impossible to date an event so precisely, but a
reasonable estimate is possible. When the precise date is not known or an approximate
date is more appropriate, the date is generalized to the month and year (e.g.,
February 1785) or to the year alone. A lack of evidence may make it impossible
to give any date at all for a county's creation, and its occurrence can only be
confirmed by the record of a later, related happening, such as the appointment
of a sheriff. In such a situation, the date of the later event is used with the
simple addition of "by" (e.g., by 25 February 1785) to indicate that
the county creation or other event occurred no later than that date and
probably earlier. The dating standard used is the legally effective date of
change, whether it be for the creation of a new county or for the alteration of
lines between existing counties.</p>

      <p>Dating events before 1752 is a problem because the calendar
then in use is very different from the one in use today. Whereas by 1600 most
of Europe had adopted the Gregorian calendar, as the modern system of reckoning
the days is called, England observed the Julian calendar until 2 September
1752. Under the old Julian calendar the last day of the year was 24 March and
the first day was 25 March, which means that in England and its colonies,
including Virginia, the day after 24 March 1750 was 25 March 1751. In its
databases this project uses the modern, Gregorian year for dates that fall
within the period from 1 January through 24 March, because software cannot
handle dual-year dates. But dual dates are cited in the text portion of an
entry, since original documents may record the date according to the Julian
calendar. Thus the date, 1 January 1735, may appear in the “Date” column of the
attribute table and database, but the descriptive entry for that date would
show the date as 1 January 1734/1735, indicating that people of the time still considered
this date to be in the year 1734.</p>

      <p><b>Pre-Territorial Period</b></p>

      <p>As territories and states were established in the American
West, the Continental Divide and Rocky Mountains served as a logical barrier
separating territorial jurisdictions. The area that became Wyoming was bisected
by the Continental Divide, which resulted in a very complex jurisdictional
history of the area prior to the establishment of Wyoming Territory. Between
the time of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and the creation of Wyoming
Territory in 1868, parts of present Wyoming fell under the jurisdiction of the
District of Louisiana, Louisiana Territory, Missouri Territory, Oregon
Territory, Washington Territory, Nebraska Territory, Dakota Territory, Utah
Territory, Idaho Territory, Spain, Mexico, and the Republic of Texas. During
those years, the District of Louisiana, the territories of Oregon, Washington,
Idaho, Utah, and Dakota, as well as the Republic of Texas, established counties
whose boundaries included parts of present Wyoming. All counties established by
other territories and the Republic of Texas are mapped in the Atlas of
Historical County Boundaries (Digital): Wyoming. While few non-Indians lived in
the vast stretches of what later became Wyoming, territorial officials wanted
to extend governmental authority throughout their jurisdiction to leave no
place beyond the law. Some of these early counties covered thousands of square
miles, yet had populations that rarely exceeded 2000 individuals.</p>

      <p>Dakota Territory played the biggest role in the modern
development of Wyoming counties. Between 1861 and 1869, major portions of
present Wyoming were part of Dakota Territory. In 1867 and 1868, Dakota created
four counties—Laramie, Carter (now Sweetwater), Carbon, and Albany—which became
the first counties of Wyoming Territory. Although the United States Congress
passed an act authorizing the creation of Wyoming Territory on 25 July 1868,
delays in the appointment of territorial officers resulted in Dakota Territory
continuing to exercise jurisdiction for an additional nine months. In fact,
Dakota Territory created Carbon and Albany Counties in December 1868. In April
and May 1869, the governor, secretary, and justices of the new territory took
their oaths of office, and Wyoming Territory was officially organized on 19 May
1869.</p>

       <p><b>Territorial Period</b></p>

      <p>One unusual feature of Wyoming’s eastern and western state
boundaries is that they are defined by meridians of longitude measured from
Washington, D.C., not Greenwich, England. An act passed by the United States
Congress in 1850 required the use of the Washington meridian “for all astronomical
purposes” (<i>U.S. Statutes at Large</i>, 9:ch. 80/p. 515). The Washington
meridians do not correspond neatly to Greenwich meridians, so that Wyoming’s
eastern boundary, 27 degrees west of Washington, corresponds precisely to the
Greenwich meridian 104 degrees, 3 minutes, 06.276 seconds. Nineteenth-century
Wyoming county boundaries are sometimes defined in terms of the Washington
meridian, and sometimes in terms of the Greenwich meridian. For example, the
line between Carbon and Sweetwater Counties was variously defined as 107
degrees, 30 minutes (Greenwich), and 30 degrees, 30 minutes (Washington). It is
clear that those two definitions were meant to be identical, and that no change
in the line was intended or implied, even though the two descriptions cited
above do not coincide exactly. Use of the Washington meridian was repealed by
an act passed in 1912, and neither state nor county lines changed as a result.
In most cases, the Greenwich meridian was used for mapping purposes in this
Atlas.</p>

      <p>One exception was made in the mapping of the 33rd 
meridian, which is cited in county boundary descriptions in Wyoming from 1867
to 1909. There are three possible ways to map the 33rd meridian. The
first would be to follow the example above and map it to coincide with 110
degrees west longitude (Greenwich). A second approach would place it exactly 3
degrees, 06.276 seconds west of 110 degrees. The third way is to select a line
halfway between 32 degrees west of Washington (the eastern boundary of Utah as
defined by statute and survey), and 34 degrees west of Washington (the western
boundary of Wyoming as defined by statute and survey). The third solution was
the one selected. Approximately two and one-half miles separate the most
eastern and western of these lines, and contemporary maps of Wyoming do not
agree on the location of the 33rd meridian. Choice number three was
selected because it results in a line that most nearly corresponds with the
present county boundary in that part of the state.</p>

      <p>The creation of America’s first national park, Yellowstone,
in 1872, affected county boundaries. Most of the park is located in Wyoming,
with small portions in Montana and Idaho. Most of the park was part of Uinta
County, which, in the late nineteenth century, covered a wide strip of
territory inside the western boundary of Wyoming. Questions arose regarding
jurisdiction within the Park’s boundaries, and, in 1884, the Wyoming
Territorial Legislature passed an act declaring that Yellowstone National Park
was part of Uinta County and authorizing justices of the peace and constables
for the area. The struggle between federal and local authorities continued, but
Yellowstone remained technically within the jurisdiction of Uinta County until
1911.</p>

       <p><b>Twentieth-Century County Boundaries</b></p>

      <p>In February 1911 Wyoming county boundaries underwent major
alterations. First, seven new counties were created, and, second, county
boundaries were redefined to run on federal land survey lines. The
redefinitions also explicitly placed Yellowstone National Park outside the
boundaries of any Wyoming county. This completed a process begun a few years
earlier to regularize county lines, which had previously been defined as lines
of longitude or latitude or as lines running through certain landmarks. In 1880
only about one-seventh of Wyoming’s land had been surveyed, but by 1910 the
land survey was about ninety percent complete (Larson, <i>History of Wyoming</i>,
173; Stewart, <i>Public Land Surveys</i>, 73). The need to reconcile the
township and range system with county boundaries resulted in the wholesale
adjustment of county lines in February 1911. In most cases the gain, loss, or
exchange of territory was small. Eight separate legislative acts, passed
between February 9 and 21, laid out this realignment. Because this legislation
was so interconnected and was passed within less than a two-week period, this
project maps all Wyoming counties as of 21 February, rather than on the exact
date of passage, to bring together all the changes set forth in the eight
separate laws. </p>

      <p>In 1929, the counties of Park and Teton were expanded to
include all of Yellowstone Park in Wyoming, once again explicitly placing it
within county jurisdiction. The last county boundary change in Wyoming occurred
in 1965 when approximately six square miles of United States Forest Service
land was transferred from Teton County to Lincoln County. This change is not
shown on many maps, including the USGS Wyoming Base Map (1:1M scale) revised in
1980, or the ESRI Digital Chart of the World. U.S. Forest Service maps do map
the boundary correctly.</p>

      <p>The three-volume <i>Wyoming Blue Book </i>(1974), edited by
Virginia Cole Trenholm, contained helpful information on the evolution of
counties and included maps. Several contemporary maps were useful in locating
places. These included <i>Masi’s Itinerary Map of Wyoming</i> (1876?), <i>Holt’s
New Map of Wyoming</i> (1883), and Samuel A. Mitchell’s, <i>Territory of
Wyoming</i> (1880).</p>
