      <p><b>Special Topics</b></p>

      <p>The many boundary adjustments,
clarifications, and redefinitions reflect the fact that for much of North
Carolina's history, counties (called precincts before 1738) were created
against a backdrop of expanding population and often inadequate geographical knowledge.
For other reasons as well, some imprecision in drawing historical county
boundaries in North Carolina is inevitable. The laws frequently direct that
boundaries run along mountain ridges, between river systems, and to the
"head" of a river or stream—directions all somewhat vague and
imprecise. Also, boundaries often involve landmarks that cannot be identified
today, for example, the property of named individuals, roads, water fords,
ferries, mills, and river landings. Finally, some boundaries were ephemeral,
disappearing completely in later boundary changes, sometimes after only a brief
period. Judging by the many boundary disputes and the stated reasons for
specific boundary changes, it is also apparent that many county boundaries were
not surveyed or clearly marked. For these reasons, some historical county
boundaries are conjectural; in this volume these are depicted with dashes
labeled "estimated line." During the early years of Euro-American
settlement in North Carolina, some boundary limits (especially western) were
left undefined; Anson (1749), Rowan (1753), Mecklenburg (1763), Tryon (1769),
and Guilford (1771), for example, had no western limits specified. These
undefined boundaries are identified in the text as "indefinite
limits" and the lines used in those cases must be viewed as no more than
convenient representations of the county limits at the time.</p>

      <p>Mountain ranges were a barrier to
precise boundary descriptions in the west, and thus many western boundaries
were altered repeatedly as settlers moved west and required more precise
boundaries. The difficulty of mapping boundary changes in the mountainous west
is illustrated by the Ashe/Wilkes boundary and, after 1859 (when Alleghany was
created from Ashe), by the Alleghany/Wilkes boundary. Ashe was created from
Wilkes in 1799, with the boundary line to run along "the extreme
height" of the Appalachian Mountains. Between 1799 and 1901 the line was
changed six times (in 1835, 1877, 1879, 1885, 1887, and 1891); all changes were
minor and involved landmarks which either cannot be located today or were made
to accommodate local property owners. In 1901 the legislature
"restored" the Ashe/Wilkes boundary to "the old boundary
line" along the "top of the Blue Ridge." But following this
return to the original 1799 boundary, the line has again been changed eight
times—in each case for the convenience of a local property owner or owners. Of
the fourteen changes, from 1799 to 1990, three laws repealed earlier boundary
changes; in the most extreme case, a boundary change enacted in 1913 was
repealed in 1957.</p>

      <p>Similarly, the boundary between
Alleghany and Wilkes Counties has been changed nine times since Alleghany was
created in 1859. In most instances the change was made for the convenience of
local property owners, and in each case only a small amount of land was
involved. Some of the uncertainty of boundary lines in mountainous areas is
also reflected in three other statutes involving the Alleghany/Wilkes line: in
1909 the legislature defined part of the boundary, citing "some dispute
and misunderstanding as to the correct line"; a 1911 law provided for the
clarification of an 1891 boundary change, declaring that the 1891 line
"has never been run and is in dispute between certain points"; and in
1939 the legislature defined part of the boundary, asserting that "there
is uncertainty as to the exact location of the county line." Other
boundaries in mountainous areas, especially in the northwest (e.g.,
Alleghany/Ashe, Ashe/Watauga, and Watauga/Wilkes), present similar problems in
mapping.</p>

      <p>In creating counties and altering
existing county boundaries, the legislature largely ignored Indian (principally
Cherokee) claims to land in present North Carolina and Tennessee (part of North
Carolina until 1790). The Indian Boundary Line of 1767, running diagonally
across the state from the present-day counties of Polk on the south to
Alleghany on the north, was devised by British colonial officials to protect
Indian lands west of the line from encroachment by Euro-American settlers. A
subsequent series of land cessions by the Indians nullified that boundary,
until by the end of the eighteenth century only the southwestern corner of
present North Carolina and approximately two-thirds of present Tennessee were
still nominally controlled by Indians.</p>

      <p>The North Carolina legislature
first referred to an Indian boundary line in drawing county boundaries in 1771,
when it directed that the Mecklenburg/Tryon boundary with Rowan (which had
"not as yet been ascertained") run due west until it intersected the
"Cherokee Indian Line." In 1777 the legislature ignored all Indian
claims to the land when it included all of present Tennessee in the newly
created Washington County and extended Burke County to the present North
Carolina/Tennessee boundary. South of Burke, Rutherford County was created from
Tryon in 1779, with its northern boundary running through the "old
Cherokee line" to the present North Carolina/Tennessee line. Roughly the
western half of Rutherford and a small part of western Burke were
"reserved" for the Cherokee in 1783, but the reservation did not
affect county boundaries. Only in the creation of Greene (Tenn.) in 1783 did
the legislature appear to have respected the boundaries of the Cherokee
reserve.</p>

      <p>Thus, by the end of the American
Revolution the North Carolina legislature had created counties for all of
present North Carolina and most of Tennessee, even though the Cherokee did not
make their final cessions of land in the two states (in southwestern North
Carolina and southeastern Tennessee) until 1835. In this atlas the county
boundary lines are drawn as described in the laws, with no allowance for Indian
claims to the land.</p>

      <p>A particular problem was posed by
boundary changes made for the convenience of named individuals, often with few
or no geographic clues as to location of the land involved. As noted above,
many of these occur in western, mountainous areas of the state; but they occur
in other parts of the state as well. Most of these changes could not be mapped
in this atlas; in the chronologies they are identified as gains or losses of
small areas to accommodate local property owners.</p>

      <p>There have never been any
constitutional restrictions on the legislature's authority to create new
counties or to alter the boundaries of existing counties. Ten county creations
have been submitted by the legislature to the voters of the affected areas for
approval. Seven were approved: Alamance (1849), Yadkin (1851), Dare (1870),
Pamlico (1872), Durham (1881), Vance (1881), and Lee (1908). Voters rejected
three creations (Hooper, 1851; Lillington, 1859; and Scotland, 1895), although
Scotland was subsequently re-created by the legislature in 1899, with no
referendum. Also, twelve boundary changes were submitted to the affected
residents for approval, beginning in 1851; nine were approved.</p>

      <p><b>Dates</b></p>

      <p>Every effort has been made to give the day, month, and
year (e.g., 25 February 1785) for all county creations, boundary changes, and
other events in this atlas. Occasionally it is impossible to date an event so
precisely, but a reasonable estimate is possible. When the precise date is not
known or an approximate date is more appropriate, the date is generalized to
the month and year (e.g., February 1785) or to the year alone. A lack of
evidence may make it impossible to give any date at all for a county's
creation, and its occurrence can only be confirmed by the record of a later,
related happening, such as the appointment of a sheriff. In such a situation,
the date of the later event is used with the simple addition of "by"
(e.g., by 25 February 1785) to indicate that the county creation or other event
occurred no later than that date and probably earlier.</p>

      <p>Several dates may be associated with the creation of a
county or a change in county lines. To many individuals the date that makes the
most sense is the one when people began to observe the change, but in most
cases that date is impossible to ascertain. An alternative is the date on which
the law effecting the change passed the legislature or was approved by the
governor. The date of passage is an important reference because it helps
identify the law; now, as in the past, references to a law often include the
date of passage. Most other compilations of county changes have adopted the
date of passage as their standard for the date of change, but it is not always
the best indicator of when change occurred.</p>

      <p>The dating standard in this atlas is the legally effective
date of change, whether it be for the creation of a new county or for the
alteration of lines between existing counties. Through the colonial period and
into the nineteenth century, the date a law passed was generally the date it
went into effect. As the nineteenth century progressed, legislators recognized
the importance of preparing for the establishment of a new county organization
or for the shift in jurisdiction that accompanies boundary changes. Some laws,
therefore, began to carry two dates: one marking the passage of the law and the
other specifying when the line change or new county creation would go into
effect. Using effective dates means that many of the dates in this atlas may
disagree with dates in other references. </p>

      <p>Before 1836 very few North Carolina session laws have a
specific date of approval; from 1836 onward, they all do. Until 1761 the only
date usually associated with the laws is the opening date of the session at
which the laws were approved; from 1761 through 1835 virtually all laws were
read three times and approved at the end of each session. In this atlas, those
dates (opening of session or blanket approval at end of session) are used for
all laws passed before 1836, when the laws have no specific date of approval or
effective date. The date of an election or referendum—when known—has been used
for the effective date for all county creations and boundary changes subject to
voter approval; in the few cases where the date of the election is unknown, the
date of the statute authorizing the election has been used. </p>

      <p>Dating events before 1752 is a problem because the
calendar then in use is very different from the one in use today. Whereas by
1600 most of Europe had adopted the Gregorian calendar, as the modern system of
reckoning the days is called, England observed the Julian calendar until 2
September 1752. For the purposes of this atlas, the chief differences between
the two systems are, first, numbering the days and, second, designating the
change from one year to the next. There has been no attempt to convert the
dates of one system to those of the other. Differences in numbering days,
therefore, are effectively ignored; whatever day and month are given in a
source are the day and month used here, regardless of whether the document was written
in England or some other country, before or after 1752. Under the old, Julian
calendar the last day of the year was 24 March and the first day was 25 March,
which means that in England and its colonies the day after 24 March 1750 was 25
March 1751. This atlas follows the convention of showing both years for dates
that fall within the period from 1 January through 24 March when the different
calendars call for different years. Thus, successive dates before England's
adoption of the Gregorian calendar would occur as follows: the day after 24
March 1688/1689 would be 25 March 1689; the day after 31 December 1689 would be
1 January 1689/1690. About three months later would come 24 March 1689/1690,
and the next day after that would be 25 March 1690.</p>
