      <p>The early development of Indiana's county boundaries was
heavily influenced by the initial presence and subsequent removal of the
Indians. The federal Ordinances of 1785 and 1787 required territorial
governments to respect Indian title to the land. Settlers were not to extend
their settlements, or their counties, into Indian territory. Nevertheless, the
Northwest Territory and Indiana Territory created counties that encroached on
Indian tribal lands. The situation had changed by the time of statehood in
1816, and the issue of Indian land ownership severely constrained county
development in the state, where Indian treaty lines often became county
boundaries.</p>

      <p>In the early years, each new land cession from the Indians
was organized into a separate, fully operational county (Ripley County was the
one exception, remaining unorganized for over a year). This pattern changed in
1820 when two pseudo-counties were created for the New Purchase, a tract of
5,800 square miles in central Indiana that had been acquired from the Miami and
Potawatomi in 1818 by the Treaty of St. Mary's. These counties were designated
Delaware New Purchase (renamed Adams New Purchase in 1827) and Wabash New
Purchase. At no time did they exist as independent, fully organized counties
and, although little is known about the thinking behind their establishment, it
appears that the state legislature never intended to let them develop in the
usual manner. They were almost immediately subdivided into various parts that
were attached to fully organized counties. These attachments shifted
frequently, creating a crazy-quilt pattern of jurisdictions, until by 1845 all
of the New Purchase had been absorbed into organized counties. </p>

      <p>All Indiana counties but one were established by statute or
by proclamation of the territorial governor; the exception is Newton County.
Newton was originally created by statute on 7 February 1835 and attached to
Jasper County, but it failed to attract enough settlers and was incorporated
into Jasper in 1839. Taking advantage of an 1857 act (repealed 1861) &quot;to
authorize the formation of new counties&quot; outside the control of the state
legislature, residents of the western half of Jasper started a movement for a
new county. On 27 February 1858, the Jasper County Board of Commissioners
accepted a recommendation to re-establish Newton County. Litigation ensued, and
the effective date of Newton's establishment was delayed until 8 December 1859
when the Indiana Supreme Court upheld the action of the commissioners.</p>

      <p>Another attempt to put control of county changes in local
hands is Public Law number 212, passed 27 February 1980 and still in effect,
which established a procedure for altering county boundaries without going
through the state legislature. County surveyors were required to file with the
Indiana Secretary of State accurate legal descriptions of their counties as of
31 August 1981 and to report any later alterations within 30 days of the
effective date of change. Apparently the county lines have remained stable
because no changes were reported to the Secretary of State's office between 31
August 1981 and 1990.</p>

      <p>One clarification emerged from those 1981 county surveyors'
reports. The surveyors of St. Joseph, Marshall, and Fulton Counties all
incorporated the Michigan Road Lands into their boundary descriptions. Earlier
descriptions in the revised statutes and state codes referred only to the
township, range, and section lines of the federal land survey and completely
ignored these lands, but it appears the layout of the Michigan Road Lands had a
slight effect on the northern and southern boundaries of Marshall and,
therefore, on its abutters, St. Joseph and Fulton. The Michigan Road was to run
from Lake Michigan to the Wabash River, and land for it was acquired in 1826 by
treaty with the Potawatomi. The land between South Bend and Logansport was
surveyed, but the lines of the road survey never matched the township, range,
and section lines of the federal land survey in the surrounding area. In 1831
the surveys and plats of the Michigan Road Lands were completed, the first land
sales were held, and road construction began. As Marshall's northern and
southern lines were being marked, when the surveyors crossed the Michigan Road
they did not make extensions of the federal land survey lines but instead
changed course slightly and followed the existing lines of the 1831 road
survey.  The boundaries of these counties were mapped according to the 1831
road survey.</p>
