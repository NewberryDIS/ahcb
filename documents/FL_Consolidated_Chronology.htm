      organized former Spanish Florida into the new British colonies of
       East Florida and West Florida. West Florida was to be bounded on
       the east by the Chattahoochee and Apalachicola Rivers, on the
      north by the parallel of 31 degrees north latitude, and on the
      west by the Mississippi River, the Iberville River, and Lake
      Pontchartrain, including parts of present Louisiana, Mississippi,
       Alabama, and Florida. East Florida encompassed the territory
      east of the Apalachicola River and south of a straight line from
      where the Apalachicola is formed by the junction of the
      Chattahoochee and Flint Rivers to the headspring of the St. Marys
       River and thence down the St. Marys to the Atlantic
      Ocean.</span>
