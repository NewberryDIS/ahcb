States claimed the Oregon Country, an area west of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase

Washington, and Idaho; parts of Montana and Wyoming, and a large portion of
Canada lying west of the Continental Divide. Great Britain, Spain and Russia

<span class='change'>A Convention of Commerce between Great Britain and the
United States established the parallel of 49 degrees north latitude, from the
Lake of the Woods to the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains, as the northern
boundary of the United States and the southern boundary of the British
possessions respectively. It was also agreed that the area “westward of the
Stony Mountains” should be jointly occupied by the United States and Great
Britain for a term of ten years. The area covered in this joint occupancy
included all of present Oregon, Washington and Idaho, parts of Montana and
Wyoming, and the portion of present Canada lying west of the Rocky Mountains
(Continental Divide). No northern limit was defined.</span>

<span class='change'>The Oregon Boundary Treaty between the United States and
Great Britain ended joint occupancy of the Oregon Country when it set the
international boundary "along the forty-ninth parallel of north latitude
to the middle of the channel which separates the continent from Vancouver's
Island; and thence southerly through the middle of said channel, and of Fuca's
Straits, to the Pacific Ocean." The treaty created a disputed area by
failing to specify which of the multiple passages through the San Juan Islands
was meant by "the middle of said channel." Great Britain claimed a
line through Rosario Strait, the eastern most passage, while the United States
claimed a line through the Strait of Haro, the western most passage. The
dispute over this water boundary was finally settled on 21 October 1872. Oregon
considered the disputed San Juan Islands to be part of LEWIS (Wash.). British
North America gained all the parts of CLACKAMAS, LEWIS (Wash.), and VANCOUVER
(Wash., now CLARK, Wash.) which lay north of 49 degrees north latitude.</span>

December 1847 the Journal of the Provisional Legislature recorded the passage
