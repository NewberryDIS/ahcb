      <span class='change'>[24 Mar 1662/1663] King Charles II created
      Carolina from Virginia colony territory and granted it as a
      proprietary colony to eight of his supporters (the Lords
      Proprietors). Limits were: on the north, the north end of Lucke
      Island and the parallel of 36 degrees north latitude; on the
      west, the Pacific Ocean; and on the south, the St. Marys River
      and, from that river westward, the parallel of 31 degrees north
      latitude. Included all of present South Carolina and the southern
       parts of present North Carolina and Tennessee.</span>

      and Craven (for the area south of Cape Romain, in present South
      Carolina). The boundaries of Clarendon and Craven were not
      defined, and they never functioned effectively as counties;
      ALBEMARLE (extinct), with broadly defined boundaries, operated only
      briefly as a county in present North Carolina.</span>
