      England (chartered to establish colonies between 40 degrees and
      48 degrees north latitude) issued a new land patent (the "Old
      Charter") that granted land title and trading rights, but no
      powers of government, to New Plymouth Colony for the area east of
       Narragansett Bay and south of a line from the Pawtucket (now
      Blackstone) River to the mouth of the Cohasset River. New
      Plymouth Colony included part of present Rhode Island.</span>
