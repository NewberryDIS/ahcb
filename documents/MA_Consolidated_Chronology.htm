      point 120 miles inland or, if closer, the limit of the colony.

      north of the Merrimack River from the coast westward to a point
      north of Pautucket Falls (now Lowell, Mass.) and thence in a

      boundary of New Hampshire in 1741 actually ran a little north of
      west, an error that later occasioned some controversy but has
