      <p>Minnesota land was
once part of the national public domain and, as such, was divided for sale
according to the federal rectangular survey system. Although some of the
earliest county creations and boundary changes in present Minnesota were based
principally on river systems and extended arbitrary lines, lawmakers quickly
recognized the utility of basing boundaries on the survey system. Thus
territorial officials began incorporating range and township lines into county
boundary descriptions early in their governance of present Minnesota, and that
practice has been continued by subsequent governing bodies. The lines laid down
by those early land surveyors are still in use and remain a prominent and
important feature of the modern maps used to make this atlas. Given the
persistence of the survey lines and their appearance on modern federal maps,
plotting county lines based on the land survey is easier and more precise than
working with metes and bounds descriptions that depend on ridge lines, river
systems, and local landmarks.</p>

      <p>A few boundary
lines cannot be precisely drawn. Some involve natural features or local
landmarks difficult to locate, while a few reflect the vagueness and
imprecision of the laws on which they are based. These uncertain boundaries are
labeled "estimated line" and "indefinite limit,"
respectively. Occasionally a boundary line cannot be drawn as described, due to
some oversight or error in the legislation or typographical error in the printed
statute. The legislature's intent is usually apparent, however, in other
provisions of the law in question or in later boundary changes, and in these
cases the intent—rather than a rigid interpretation—of the law has been
followed.</p>

      <p>The Minnesota state
constitution of 1857 (still in effect, as amended) stipulates that no new
county can be created containing less than 400 square miles and that no
existing county can be reduced below that size by boundary changes. The
constitution also requires that all boundary changes involving organized
counties be approved by the voters of each affected county. An 1893 law
required that new counties have at least 2,000 inhabitants (and no existing
county could be reduced below that), and in 1913 the legislature required that
counties (new and existing) have an assessed property valuation of at least
$4,000,000. In 1917 the valuation requirement was dropped to $3,000,000 for
counties having between 3,500-6,000 square miles, and that was further reduced
to $2,500,000 in 1919.</p>

      <p>In 1893 the legislature
also provided for local initiative in creating new counties, with no
involvement by the legislature. If petitions signed by at least 15% of the
legal voters of each of the counties affected by the creation of the proposed
county were submitted to the secretary of state, the governor—after validation
of the petitions—was to call for a referendum on the question at the next
general election. If the voters approved, the governor proclaimed the new
county "one of the duly organized counties" of Minnesota. In 1895 the
law was amended to require that the petitions be signed by at least 25% of the
legal voters, and it stipulated that the voters could vote on only one such
proposition at each election. Although the 1893 and 1895 laws dealt
specifically with the creation of new counties, the Revised Laws of 1905
extended the provisions to changing the boundaries of existing counties as
well. A 1913 amendment to the Revised Laws also required that referenda on
creating new counties must pass by a majority vote in the area which is to form
the new county—as well as in each of the counties affected.</p>

      <p>The 1893 law
providing for local initiative in creating counties resulted in a flurry of
proposed new counties—many of which failed in referenda and some of which ended
up in the courts for adjudication. Hubbard County (1883) was the last county
created by the legislature; between 1894 and 1922, eight counties were created
by local initiative: Clearwater, Columbia (later nullified by the state supreme
court), Koochiching, Lake of the Woods, Mahnomen, Pennington, Red Lake, and
Roseau.</p>

      <p>Most of the
attempts were to create new counties out of Polk County. In November 1894 all
four counties proposed were defeated in referenda: Columbia, Nash, Nelson, and
Red Lake. At the next general election, in November 1896, Polk voters voted on
six proposals for new counties—some of which had overlapping boundaries.
Garfield, Hill, and Nelson were defeated, while Columbia, Mills, and Red Lake
each passed on a majority vote. The governor proclaimed Red Lake the sole
winner, and the state supreme court upheld that determination. The creation of
Columbia County from Polk in November 1902 also ended up in the state supreme
court for final resolution. In that election, the proposed counties of Nelson
and Star were also approved by Polk voters (Valley was defeated), but the
governor proclaimed only Columbia as being created. The court overturned that
decision in April 1903, and Columbia thus became extinct. The final attempt to
create a new county from Polk was made in November 1908, when the proposed
county of Nelson was defeated in a referendum.</p>

      <p>In ruling on the
referenda of 1896 and 1902, the state supreme court noted in its 1903 opinion
that the 1893 law (and amendment of 1895) was "a very difficult statute to
construe. It is badly constructed, and far from complete in many respects. It
has been before this court more than once...." Red Lake's creation in 1896
was upheld by the court, even though the voters also approved the creation of
Columbia and Mills at the same election. In rejecting Columbia and Mills, the
court ruled that any Polk County elector could legally sign any non-competing
petitions for creation of new counties, that all proposed creations supported
by valid petitions must be submitted to the voters, but that only one of the
competing propositions could be approved at the same election. Finally, the
court asserted that the winning proposal must have a majority of the votes cast
on it, as well as a plurality of the votes cast on the propositions with which
it was competing. Red Lake met the test; Columbia and Mills did not.</p>

      <p>The provisions of
the 1893 and 1895 laws were again at issue in 1903 when the state supreme court
set aside the creation of Columbia (declared the winner of the 1902 election by
the governor). This time, all four proposed counties (Columbia, Nelson, Star,
and Valley) covered the same territory of Polk County, and the contest was
principally over location of the county seat of the new county. Columbia polled
more votes than Nelson and Star at the election on 4 November 1902 (the
proposal to create Valley County was defeated), and the governor duly
proclaimed the new county of Columbia. In striking down the governor's
decision, the court ruled that only one proposition involving the same
territory can be voted on at each election, and that the first valid petition
presented for creation of a new county has precedence when more than one are
filed. In this case, the petition to create Nelson County was filed with the
secretary of state on 13 December 1900, whereas the petition for Columbia was
filed the next day. The court consequently ruled the election and creation of
Columbia invalid. Parenthetically, the court noted that there must be
"material and substantial" differences in the territory to be
included in each proposed county when more than one appeared on the ballot at
the same election.</p>

      <p>There were also
efforts in 1894 to create one or two new counties in the
Nicollet/Renville/Sibley area, although neither proposal was submitted to the
voters (and one apparently never went beyond the petition stage). The proposed
county of Birch Coulee (or Birch Cooley) was to include eleven or twelve
adjoining full and partial townships of western Nicollet, southeastern Renville,
and western Sibley, and although the governor called for a referendum on the
proposal, the election was never held. A separate petition drive aimed to
combine seven townships in eastern and northeastern Renville County with
adjoining Sibley townships to form a new county. Both of these efforts were
closely related to the spirited contest in early 1894 for location of the
Renville county seat (Olivia was chosen in a special election in June 1894).</p>

      <p>Many Minnesota
counties were created before there was adequate population to support them, and
the legislature consequently devised a system of attachments, whereby newly
created counties were often attached to existing counties for various purposes.
In some cases, the statute creating a county provided for the full organization
of the county, including provisions for electing the county commissioners and
county officers. At the same time, the new county was often attached to an
existing county, usually "for judicial purposes," "for judicial
and record purposes," or "for judicial and other purposes." The
precise nature of some of these attachments is not always clear, and thus the
precise wording of the phrase is included in both the main chronology and
individual county chronology in quotation marks.</p>

      <p>Many counties were
not "organized," i.e., authorized to conduct county business, at
creation. In those cases a separate statute was generally enacted to effect the
county organization, designated as organized for county purposes in this atlas.
There was often a considerable delay between creation of a county and its
organization for county purposes; Beltrami County, for example, was created in
1866 but not fully organized for county purposes until 1897. For much of the
intervening period it was attached to Becker County "for record and
judicial purposes." Seventy-seven of Minnesota's 87 counties were
organized for county purposes by statute, either at creation or later; for the
9 counties (Chippewa, Dodge, Goodhue, Lyon, Mille Lacs, Olmstead, Otter Tail,
Swift, and Watonwan) for which no "organizing" statute has been
found, the county is considered organized for county purposes in this atlas on
the date of the first meeting of the county commissioners. Hennepin was fully
organized when the U.S. Senate ratified the Treaty of Mendota with the Sioux.</p>

      <p>Some of the ambiguity in the
status of counties was reflected in the state supreme court’s ruling in 1878
concerning the status of big Stone County as an organized county. Big Stone was
created in 1862, and in 1873 and 1874 the board of county commissioners
(appointed by the governor) proceeded to fill the other county offices which
organized counties typically had. The county officers were chosen again in the
general elections of 1874 and 1876, and they fully performed the duties of
their respective offices. bills to “organize” Big Stone were introduced into
the legislature in 1873, 1874,and 1875, but all failed, and thus the county’s
status as an organized county was challenged in court. the district court ruled
that Big Stone was “for all the purposes” of the relevant statutes an organized
county, but the supreme court overturned that decision.</p>

      <p>In
rejecting Big Stone’s status as an organized county, the supreme court noted
that the state constitution (Article XI) “recognizes” a distinction between
organized and established counties. The court defined the “establishing” of a
county as “the setting apart of certain territory to be in the future organized
as a political community, or quasi-corporation for political purposes; and the
organizing of a county is the vesting in the people of such territory such
corporate rights and powers.” Futher, the court ruled that the state
constitution vested the power of establishing and organizing counties “wholly”
with the legislature, “and, until some act of the legislature authorizing it,
the people of no district have the right to act as an organized county.</p>

      <p>n this
atlas, twenty-two counties are identified as “fully organized” (for county
government and judicial and other purposes) at creation. For the other
counties, in the absence of a specific reference to organization or attachment,
the reader should assume that each county was unorganized for county government
purposes and unattached for judicial and other purposes until stated otherwise.
Mille Lacs County, for example, was created (or established) on 23 May 1857 –
unorganized and unattached. On 18 March 1858 it was attached to Morrison County
“for judicial purposes,” and on 25 February 1860 it was “organized” for county
government. However, Mille Lacs was not “fully organized” until it was detached
from Morrison on 31 July 1866.</p>

      <p>Approximately 100
proposed county creations and boundary changes have been submitted to the
voters for approval. Virtually all of these referenda were held at the regular
general elections in November. Where there is specific evidence that the
referendum passed (or there is a reasonable inference thereof), the date of the
referendum is used as the effective date in the text. In cases where it is
known that the referendum failed, the referendum is marked as having
"failed" and the date of the law authorizing the referendum is used
for the entry. Finally, the phrase "change not effected" is used for
some proposed boundary changes when it is clear that the boundary did not
change, but for which no information about the required referendum has been
located.</p>

      <p>Although
territorial and state officials generally respected Indian rights to the land
and often incorporated Indian boundary lines in county boundaries, they
routinely extended county lines in present Minnesota to the limits of their
jurisdiction. They thus anticipated and encouraged the migration of non-Indian
settlers into the region well before the Indian tribes ceded their territory to
the government. In this atlas the county boundaries are drawn as described in
the laws, with due regard to the Indian boundary lines when they were part of
the boundary—but with no recognition of the gradual purchase of Indian lands by
territorial, state, and federal governments.</p>
