<span class='change'>Boundary dispute between the states of Iowa and Missouri
reached U.S. Supreme Court: dispute involved location of the rapids of the Des
Moines River, from which point the boundary was to run due west. Missouri's
interpretation put the boundary approximately 10 miles north of the present
boundary (implicitly overlapping the Iowa counties of APPANOOSE, DAVIS,
DECATUR, GREMONT, PAGE, RINGGOLD, TAYLOR, VAN BUREN, and WAYNE); Iowa argued
for a line approximately 7 miles south of the present boundary (implicitly
overlapping the Missouri counties of ATCHISON, CLARK, DODGE, HARRISON, MERCER,
NODAWAY, PUTNAM, SCHUYLER, SCOTLAND, and non-county area attached to GENTRY and
HARRISON).</span>

<span class='change'>U.S. Supreme Court settled boundary dispute between Iowa and
Missouri by rejecting both states' claims, choosing instead the Indian boundary
line run and marked by John C. Sullivan in 1816 (the commonly accepted boundary
before the dispute arose and the present boundary between the two states). The
decision ended CLARK's overlap of the Iowa county of VAN BUREN. Also ended was
Missouri's implicit overlap with the Iowa counties of APPANOOSE, DAVIS,
DECATUR, FREMONT, PAGE, RINGGOLD, TAYLOR, VAN BUREN, and WAYNE, and Iowa's
implicit overlap with the Missouri counties of ATCHISON, CLARK, DODGE
