         <span class='change'>Rhode Island and Connecticut agreed on their mutual boundary substantially
      along the line established by colonial agents in 1662, described in Rhode Island's 1663 charter, and
       claimed since then by Rhode Island. Boundary was to run up the Pawcatuck River to the junction with
       the Ashaway River, thence a straight line to the southwestern corner of the Warwick Purchase, and
      thence due north to the southern line of Massachusetts. Although not confirmed in London until
      February 1726/1727, this boundary appears to have become effective almost immediately, and, except
      for small refinements through surveying, it has not changed since.</span>
