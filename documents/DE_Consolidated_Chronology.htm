      establish colonies along the coast of North America, including
      islands within 100 miles and, by implication, extending inland
      100 miles: the Virginia Company of London, assigned coast between
       34 degrees and 41 degrees north latitude; and the Virginia
      Company of Plymouth, assigned coast between 38 degrees and 45
      degrees north latitude. Colonies of the two companies were to be
      at least 100 miles apart, even in area (including present
      Delaware) of overlapping grants.</span>
