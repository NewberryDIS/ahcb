      <span class='change'>The United States created an unnamed
      district from land ceded by Maryland and Virginia to be the seat
      of national government. The district was a square with each
      corner at a point of the compass (north, east, south, and west)
      and each side ten miles long. Until 1801 the county jurisdictions
       of Maryland and Virginia continued in the ceded areas.</span>

      <span class='change'>The federal government established a
      circuit court for the seat of national government, now called the
       District of Columbia, and created two counties to administer
      judicial and administrative functions: ALEXANDRIA (now ARLINGTON, Va.)
      covered the the part of the district west of the Potomac River that had
      been ceded from FAIRFAX (Va.) in 1791; WASHINGTON (extinct) covered
      the area east of the Potomac River that had been ceded from
      MONTGOMERY (Md.) and PRINCE GEORGES (Md.) in 1791. The two counties
      shared concurrent jurisdiction of the Potomac. FAIRFAX (Va.), 
      MONTGOMERY (Md.) and PRINCE GEORGES (Md.) eliminated from the 
      District of Columbia.</span>
